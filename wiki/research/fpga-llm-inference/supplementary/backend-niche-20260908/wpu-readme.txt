# WPU — **W**eight **P**rocessing **U**nit

**A Verilog inference accelerator that runs published open-weight LLMs on a local, offline box —
bit-exactly, with no conversion.**

> **Everyone else named their chip after the math** — Tensor, Neural, Language *Processing Unit*.
> **This one is named after the bottleneck: the weights.** Frontier LLM inference is not
> compute-bound, it is *weight-bandwidth*-bound — `tok/s ≈ memory bandwidth ÷ GB of weights read
> per token` — so the die is sized to *consume a weight stream* rather than to maximize FLOPS, and
> it reads the published weight files (GGUF k-quants) **bit-exactly, with no conversion step**.

## Model targets

**This branch (`main`) is the hub** — the project overview, the site, and the paper. **The RTL and
its verification gates live on one branch per model target**, because each model is a different
compute graph even though the memory system, the Q4_K datapath and the whole verification harness
are shared.

| Model | Checkpoint | Branch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GLM-5.3-Flash** | [`unsloth/GLM-5.3-Flash-GGUF : UD-Q4_K_XL`](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-5.3-Flash-GGUF)<br>320.8B hybrid MoE (16.7B active/token), 199.70 GB<br>212 GB resident at 1M context | [`glm5.3-flash/UD-Q4_K_XL`](https://github.com/Wick-Lim/WPU/tree/glm5.3-flash/UD-Q4_K_XL) | **Current target. Config LOCKED, datapath in progress.** Arch `glm5next` — not a re-dimensioned GLM-5.2. **Landed:** Q5_K dequant (34.9 % of bytes — reference + RTL + must-fail gate, checked on real published bytes), the asymmetric clamped SwiGLU, **all four non-GEMV KDA units** (`make kda` / `kda-conv` / `kda-gate` / `kda-onorm`), an **fp32 sigmoid** the repo did not have — Newton reciprocal, saturation to exactly 1.0 and exactly 0.0 (`make fp-sigmoid`) — and **hyper-connections end to end** — map *and* residual path (`make mhc-sinkhorn` / `mhc-map` / `mhc-gemv` / `mhc-ops` / `mhc-site` / `hc-block`: six gated targets, 25 must-fail injections), so **`GLM53F_HC_RTL_PRESENT` is the first of the three guard conditions to close**. and the **KDA layer** as a unit (`make kda-layer`: nine projections sequenced, one conv over the concatenation of q,k,v, forget gate, delta-rule recurrence, gated o_norm, owning both the `[H,DK,DV]` state and the conv history). and **the Q8_0 weight streaming that makes it a sublayer** (`make kda-attn`: `glm53f_kda_gemv` streams the nine projections off `glm_matmul_q4k`, `glm53f_kda_attn` is the whole thing), so **`GLM53F_KDA_RTL_PRESENT` is the second guard condition to close** — only Q5_K still poisons the whole-model top. Q8_0 needed *nothing* new from the engine, and the bound did not move: the same composed bounds as the layer gate, identical measured worst 7.8e-3. and **the Q5_K read path** (`make q5k-loader`: the packer emits the tile, the real loader streams it), so **all three guard conditions are closed** and `GLM53F_FULL_TOP_OK` is defined. **Open — and none of it is a missing machine:** nothing instantiates the two machines into a decoder layer; `glm_q4k_system` has never had a per-tensor weight descriptor for *any* type (it drives the loader with a hardcoded single tile and no `desc_wtype`); the 4.19 MB/layer recurrent state still has to move to BRAM/DDR (a memory decision); and the llama.cpp seal is physically blocked with no checkout. A passing elaboration is not a working model. **An earlier version of this row said KDA was blocked on shared decoder RTL — it is not**: that assumed reusing `glm_decoder_block_q4k`, and these are siblings that declare their own port widths. Every dimension is cited from the GGUF and gated; the whole-model top stays un-elaboratable until KDA and Q5_K land. |
| **GLM-5.2** | [`unsloth/GLM-5.2-GGUF : UD-Q4_K_XL`](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-5.2-GGUF)<br>753B MoE (~40B active/token), ~467 GB | [`glm5.2/UD-Q4_K_XL`](https://github.com/Wick-Lim/WPU/tree/glm5.2/UD-Q4_K_XL) | **The proven build.** Full datapath bit-exact vs an independent ggml reference, memory-system controllers formally verified, whole product top placed & routed on a real FPGA. The paper is about this build, and the GLM-5.3-Flash branch forked from its tip. |
| **Laguna-S-2.1** | [`unsloth/Laguna-S-2.1-GGUF : UD-Q4_K_XL`](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Laguna-S-2.1-GGUF)<br>118B MoE (~8B active/token) | [`laguna-s-2.1/UD-Q4_K_XL`](https://github.com/Wick-Lim/WPU/tree/laguna-s-2.1/UD-Q4_K_XL) | **Port in progress.** Dequant inherited unchanged; MoE path bit-exact in RTL at Laguna's config; the (different) GQA attention machine is specified and reference-verified end to end — the bit-exact orchestrator RTL is scoped, not yet written. |

**Branch naming:** `<model>/<quantization>`, e.g. `glm5.2/UD-Q4_K_XL`. A second quantization of the
same model is a sibling branch under the same model prefix.

## Why a second model was cheap — and what it actually cost

Porting to Laguna-S-2.1 measured how much of this design is model-independent:

- **Inherited unchanged (~70–80%).** The Q4_K / Q6_K / Q8_0 dequant contract is *format-level*, so
  it carries to any GGUF k-quant with no work at all. The Q4_K GEMM core, RMSNorm, softmax, the MoE
  router / expert path, the whole memory system (multi-channel DDR5 + expert cache + KV pager +
  weight/boot loaders + multi-clock CDC), and the entire verification harness are
  dimension-parameterized.
- **Genuinely new per model: the attention machine.** GLM-5.2 uses MLA + DSA sparse attention;
  Laguna uses GQA with per-layer head counts, sliding-window layers, dual YaRN/plain RoPE and
  per-head softplus output gating. That is what each model branch actually builds.

That split is why the model branches exist — and why shared-core work is worth merging across them
rather than forking outright.

**GLM-5.3-Flash is the case that tests the 70–80% figure, and partly breaks it.** Being a
same-family successor was expected to make it the *cheapest* port yet. It is not:

- The attention machine changed again, and this time it *doubled*: the model is a hybrid, so the
  branch needs **both** the inherited MLA+DSA machine (11 of 45 layers) **and** a KDA
  linear-attention machine that does not exist (34 of 45).
- The residual path changed — hyper-connections with Sinkhorn normalization on every block. Nothing
  in the "attention is the only per-model part" split anticipated that.
- **The dequant contract was the one thing assumed to be free**, because it is format-level rather
  than model-level. GLM-5.3-Flash's UD-Q4_K_XL mix uses **Q5_K**, which this repo had never
  implemented, for 34.9% of its bytes (it has since landed on the port branch — as
  Q4_K with a wider code on an existing bus, which is the cheap case; it still
  had to be *built*, and its gate still had to be made non-vacuous). Format-level portability holds only across the *set of
  formats already built*; a k-quant mix is a per-checkpoint fact, and it must be read from the GGUF
  rather than assumed.

It also moves the hardware plan, in the other direction. Only 11 of 45 layers cache KV and NoPE strips
the rotary tail off the cached latent, so the 1M-context KV falls from ~94 GB to **11.8 GB** and the
whole resident footprint from ~561 GB to **212 GB**. That re-sizes rung ③ (256 GB — but built as
16 × 16 GB, because the 1024-bit bus follows package count, not capacity), leaves rung ④'s HBM tier
~8× oversized, and newly puts an all-HBM residency in reach that GLM-5.2 could not touch. None of it
changes the tok/s, which still divide by an `A_eff` this model has not been measured for.

## The discipline

Every claim carries the *kind* of evidence behind it, and the words are not interchangeable:
**PROVEN** (a gated bit-exact / functional simulation), **FORMAL** (a solver proof), **MEASURED**
(real RTL cycles or a real silicon fit), **ELABORATED** (structural only), **[EST]**
(roofline-modeled, *not* measured on silicon), **NOT-YET** (a real, open gap, stated as one).

Two habits keep that honest:

- **Every load-bearing gate is paired with a must-fail injection build.** A test that cannot fail
  proves nothing, so each one is also run against a deliberately broken variant it *must* catch.
- **The release gate pins the exact test count of every gate.** A testbench that silently runs
  fewer tests than intended is a regression, and the manifest turns that into a build failure.

What is *not* done is stated as plainly as what is: no silicon exists, no throughput figure has been
measured on hardware, and llama.cpp whole-runtime numeric equality is out-of-contract by design.
The per-claim ledger lives in each model branch's README.
