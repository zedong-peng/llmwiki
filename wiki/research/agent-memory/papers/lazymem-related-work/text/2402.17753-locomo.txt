 Let's write a graph representing events that occur in a person's life based on a short summary of their
 personality. Nodes represent events and edges represent the influence of past sub-events on a current event.
 - The graph is represented in the form of a json list.
 - Each entry is a dictionary containing the following keys: "event", “date", "caused_by", "id".
 - The "event" field contains a short description of the event.
 - The “date" field contains a date.
 - The "id" field contains a unique identifier for the event.
 - The "caused_by" field represents edges and is a list of "id" of existing events that have caused this event.
 Events in the "caused_by" field should occur on dates before the event they have caused. Generate as many
 causal connections as possible.
 - An example of a causal effect is when the event "started a vegetable garden" causes "harvested tomatoes".
 - Events can be positive or negative life events.




 For the following input personality, generate three independent events E1, E2 and E3 aligned with their
 personality. Events can be positive or negative life events and should reflect evolution in the person's
 relationships, state of mind, personality etc.




 For the following input personality, generate new events that are caused by one or more EXISTING events. Events
 can be positive or negative life events and should reflect evolution in the person's relationships, state of
 mind, personality etc. Do not repeat existing sub-events. Start and end your answer with a square bracket.

 Let's write short image search queries from textual descriptions of photos shared by a user.
 Queries should not include names of people, years and other irrelevant details. For example:

 Input: That sounds relaxing, Jeremy! As for video game suggestions, have you ever tried "The Legend
 of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"? It's an open-world adventure game that I absolutely love. [shares a
 photo of Link standing in front of a breathtaking landscape] Have a look at this stunning view!
 Output: the legend of zelda: breath of wild link landscape

 Input: {generated_image_caption}
 Output:

 {speaker_1_persona}
 {speaker_2_persona}

 {speaker_1_name} says, {current_turn}, and shares a photo of {shared_image_caption_blip2}. Write
 the most natural question or comment {speaker_2_name} can include in their response.

generated by the virtual agent into an image query for the web-based image crawler in our pipeline (top), and the
prompt used to generate a response grounded in the image shared by a virtual agent during a conversation as well as
the personas of the respective speakers (bottom).
