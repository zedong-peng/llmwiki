arXiv:2504.19413v1 [cs.CL] 28 Apr 2025
                                            Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess in generating contextually coherent
                                            responses, yet their fixed context windows pose fundamental challenges for maintaining consistency over
                                            prolonged multi-session dialogues. We introduce Mem0, a scalable memory-centric architecture that addresses
                                            this issue by dynamically extracting, consolidating, and retrieving salient information from ongoing conver-
                                            sations. Building on this foundation, we further propose an enhanced variant that leverages graph-based
                                            memory representations to capture complex relational structures among conversational elements. Through
                                            comprehensive evaluations on the LOCOMO benchmark, we systematically compare our approaches against six
                                            baseline categories: (i) established memory-augmented systems, (ii) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
                                            with varying chunk sizes and k-values, (iii) a full-context approach that processes the entire conversation
                                            history, (iv) an open-source memory solution, (v) a proprietary model system, and (vi) a dedicated memory
                                            management platform. Empirical results demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform all existing
                                            memory systems across four question categories: single-hop, temporal, multi-hop, and open-domain. No-
                                            tably, Mem0 achieves 26% relative improvements in the LLM-as-a-Judge metric over OpenAI, while Mem0 with
                                            graph memory achieves around 2% higher overall score than the base Mem0 configuration. Beyond accuracy
                                            gains, we also markedly reduce computational overhead compared to the full-context approach. In particular,
                                            Mem0 attains a 91% lower p95 latency and saves more than 90% token cost, thereby offering a compelling
                                            balance between advanced reasoning capabilities and practical deployment constraints. Our findings highlight
                                            the critical role of structured, persistent memory mechanisms for long-term conversational coherence, paving
                                            the way for more reliable and efficient LLM-driven AI agents.

                                         1. Introduction
                                         Human memory is a foundation of intelligence—it shapes our identity, guides decision-making, and enables
                                         us to learn, adapt, and form meaningful relationships (Craik and Jennings, 1992). Among its many roles,
                                         memory is essential for communication: we recall past interactions, infer preferences, and construct evolving
                                         mental models of those we engage with (Assmann, 2011). This ability to retain and retrieve information
                                         over extended periods enables coherent, contextually rich exchanges that span days, weeks, or even months.
                                         AI agents, powered by large language models (LLMs), have made remarkable progress in generating fluent,
                                         contextually appropriate responses (Yu et al., 2024, Zhang et al., 2024). However, these systems are
                                         fundamentally limited by their reliance on fixed context windows, which severely restrict their ability to
                                         maintain coherence over extended interactions (Bulatov et al., 2022, Liu et al., 2023). This limitation stems
                                         from LLMs’ lack of persistent memory mechanisms that can extend beyond their finite context windows.
                                         While humans naturally accumulate and organize experiences over time, forming a continuous narrative

of interactions, AI systems cannot inherently persist information across separate sessions or after context
overflow. The absence of persistent memory creates a fundamental disconnect in human-AI interaction.
Without memory, AI agents forget user preferences, repeat questions, and contradict previously established
facts. Consider a simple example illustrated in Figure 1, where a user mentions being vegetarian and
avoiding dairy products in an initial conversation. In a subsequent session, when the user asks about dinner
recommendations, a system without persistent memory might suggest chicken, completely contradicting
the established dietary preferences. In contrast, a system with persistent memory would maintain this
critical user information across sessions and suggest appropriate vegetarian, dairy-free options. This common
scenario highlights how memory failures can fundamentally undermine user experience and trust.
    Beyond conversational settings, memory mechanisms have been shown to dramatically enhance agent
performance in interactive environments (Majumder et al., Shinn et al., 2023). Agents equipped with
memory of past experiences can better anticipate user needs, learn from previous mistakes, and generalize
knowledge across tasks (Chhikara et al., 2023). Research demonstrates that memory-augmented agents
improve decision-making by leveraging causal relationships between actions and outcomes, leading to more
effective adaptation in dynamic scenarios (Rasmussen et al., 2025). Hierarchical memory architectures
(Packer et al., 2023, Sarthi et al., 2024) and agentic memory systems capable of autonomous evolution (Xu
et al., 2025) have further shown that memory enables more coherent, long-term reasoning across multiple
dialogue sessions.
    Unlike humans, who dynamically integrate new information and revise outdated beliefs, LLMs effectively
“reset" once information falls outside their context window (Zhang, 2024, Timoneda and Vera, 2025). Even
as models like OpenAI’s GPT-4 (128K tokens) (Hurst et al., 2024), o1 (200K context) (Jaech et al., 2024),
Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet (200K tokens) (Anthropic, 2025), and Google’s Gemini (at least 10M tokens)
(Team et al., 2024) push the boundaries of context length, these improvements merely delay rather than
solve the fundamental limitation. In practical applications, even these extended context windows prove
insufficient for two critical reasons. First, as meaningful human-AI relationships develop over weeks or
months, conversation history inevitably exceeds even the most generous context limits. Second, and perhaps
more importantly, real-world conversations rarely maintain thematic continuity. A user might mention dietary
preferences (being vegetarian), then engage in hours of unrelated discussion about programming tasks,
before returning to food-related queries about dinner options. In such scenarios, a full-context approach
would need to reason through mountains of irrelevant information, with the critical dietary preferences
potentially buried among thousands of tokens of coding discussions. Moreover, simply presenting longer
contexts does not ensure effective retrieval or utilization of past information, as attention mechanisms


                                                         2

degrade over distant tokens (Guo et al., 2024, Nelson et al., 2024). This limitation is particularly problematic
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and enterprise support, where maintaining continuity
and trust is crucial (Hatalis et al., 2023). To address these challenges, AI agents must adopt memory systems
that go beyond static context extension. A robust AI memory should selectively store important information,
consolidate related concepts, and retrieve relevant details when needed—mirroring human cognitive processes
(He et al., 2024). By integrating such mechanisms, we can develop AI agents that maintain consistent
personas, track evolving user preferences, and build upon prior exchanges. This shift will transform AI from
transient, forgetful responders into reliable, long-term collaborators, fundamentally redefining the future of
conversational intelligence.
    In this paper, we address a fundamental limitation in AI systems: their inability to maintain coher-
ent reasoning across extended conversations across different sessions, which severely restricts meaningful
long-term interactions with users. We introduce Mem0 (pronounced as mem-zero), a novel memory archi-
tecture that dynamically captures, organizes, and retrieves salient information from ongoing conversations.
                                                g
Building on this foundation, we develop Mem0 , which enhances the base architecture with graph-based
memory representations to better model complex relationships between conversational elements. Our
experimental results on the LOCOMO benchmark demonstrate that our approaches consistently outperform
existing memory systems—including memory-augmented architectures, retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) methods, and both open-source and proprietary solutions—across diverse question types, while
simultaneously requiring significantly lower computational resources. Latency measurements further reveal
that Mem0 operates with 91% lower response times than full-context approaches, striking an optimal balance
between sophisticated reasoning capabilities and practical deployment constraints. These contributions
represent a meaningful step toward AI systems that can maintain coherent, context-aware conversations over
extended durations—mirroring human communication patterns and opening new possibilities for applications
in personal tutoring, healthcare, and personalized assistance.


2. Proposed Methods
We introduce two memory architectures for AI agents. (1) Mem0 implements a novel paradigm that extracts,
evaluates, and manages salient information from conversations through dedicated modules for memory
extraction and updation. The system processes a pair of messages between either two user participants or a
                                 g
user and an assistant. (2) Mem0 extends this foundation by incorporating graph-based memory representa-
tions, where memories are stored as directed labeled graphs with entities as nodes and relationships as edges.
This structure enables a deeper understanding of the connections between entities. By explicitly modeling
                                            g
both entities and their relationships, Mem0 supports more advanced reasoning across interconnected facts,
especially for queries that require navigating complex relational paths across multiple memories.


2.1. Mem0

Our architecture follows an incremental processing paradigm, enabling it to operate seamlessly within
ongoing conversations. As illustrated in Figure 2, the complete pipeline architecture consists of two phases:
extraction and update.
    The extraction phase initiates upon ingestion of a new message pair (mt−1 , mt ), where mt represents the
current message and mt−1 the preceding one. This pair typically consists of a user message and an assistant
response, capturing a complete interaction unit. To establish appropriate context for memory extraction, the
system employs two complementary sources: (1) a conversation summary S retrieved from the database that


                                                          3
                       Mem0: Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Scalable Long-Term Memory




Figure 2: Architectural overview of the Mem0 system showing extraction and update phase. The extraction phase
processes messages and historical context to create new memories. The update phase evaluates these extracted
memories against similar existing ones, applying appropriate operations through a Tool Call mechanism. The database
serves as the central repository, providing context for processing and storing updated memories.


encapsulates the semantic content of the entire conversation history, and (2) a sequence of recent messages
{mt−m , mt−m+1 , ..., mt−2 } from the conversation history, where m is a hyperparameter controlling the recency
window. To support context-aware memory extraction, we implement an asynchronous summary generation
module that periodically refreshes the conversation summary. This component operates independently of the
main processing pipeline, ensuring that memory extraction consistently benefits from up-to-date contextual
information without introducing processing delays. While S provides global thematic understanding across
the entire conversation, the recent message sequence offers granular temporal context that may contain
relevant details not consolidated in the summary. This dual contextual information, combined with the new
message pair, forms a comprehensive prompt P = (S, {mt−m , ..., mt−2 }, mt−1 , mt ) for an extraction function
ϕ implemented via an LLM. The function ϕ(P) then extracts a set of salient memories Ω = {ω1 , ω2 , ..., ωn }
specifically from the new exchange while maintaining awareness of the conversation’s broader context,
resulting in candidate facts for potential inclusion in the knowledge base.
    Following extraction, the update phase evaluates each candidate fact against existing memories to
maintain consistency and avoid redundancy. This phase determines the appropriate memory management
operation for each extracted fact ωi ∈ Ω. Algorithm 1, mentioned in Appendix B, illustrates this process. For
each fact, the system first retrieves the top s semantically similar memories using vector embeddings from the
database. These retrieved memories, along with the candidate fact, are then presented to the LLM through
a function-calling interface we refer to as a ‘tool call.’ The LLM itself determines which of four distinct
operations to execute: ADD for creation of new memories when no semantically equivalent memory exists;
UPDATE for augmentation of existing memories with complementary information; DELETE for removal of
memories contradicted by new information; and NOOP when the candidate fact requires no modification to
the knowledge base. Rather than using a separate classifier, we leverage the LLM’s reasoning capabilities
to directly select the appropriate operation based on the semantic relationship between the candidate fact
and existing memories. Following this determination, the system executes the provided operations, thereby
maintaining knowledge base coherence and temporal consistency.

phase uses LLMs to convert conversation messages into entities and relation triplets. The update phase employs conflict
detection and resolution mechanisms when integrating new information into the existing knowledge graph.


    In our experimental evaluation, we configured the system with ‘m’ = 10 previous messages for contextual
reference and ‘s’ = 10 similar memories for comparative analysis. All language model operations utilized
GPT-4o-mini as the inference engine. The vector database employs dense embeddings to facilitate efficient
similarity search during the update phase.

2.2. Mem0
           g
The Mem0 pipeline, illustrated in Figure 3, implements a graph-based memory approach that effectively
captures, stores, and retrieves contextual information from natural language interactions (Zhang et al.,
2022). In this framework, memories are represented as a directed labeled graph G = (V, E, L), where:

   • Nodes V represent entities (e.g., A l ic e, San _ Fr anc i s co)
   • Edges E represent relationships between entities (e.g., l i v e s _ i n)
   • Labels L assign semantic types to nodes (e.g., A l ic e - Person, San _ Fr anc i s co - City)

    Each entity node v ∈ V contains three components: (1) an entity type classification that categorizes
the entity (e.g., Person, Location, Event), (2) an embedding vector ev that captures the entity’s semantic
meaning, and (3) metadata including a creation timestamp tv . Relationships in our system are structured as
triplets in the form (vs , r, vd ), where vs and vd are source and destination entity nodes, respectively, and r is
the labeled edge connecting them.
    The extraction process employs a two-stage pipeline leveraging LLMs to transform unstructured text into
structured graph representations. First, an entity extractor module processes the input text to identify a set
of entities along with their corresponding types. In our framework, entities represent the key information
elements in conversations—including people, locations, objects, concepts, events, and attributes that merit
representation in the memory graph. The entity extractor identifies these diverse information units by
analyzing the semantic importance, uniqueness, and persistence of elements in the conversation. For instance,
in a conversation about travel plans, entities might include destinations (cities, countries), transportation
modes, dates, activities, and participant preferences—essentially any discrete information that could be
relevant for future reference or reasoning.

                        Mem0: Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Scalable Long-Term Memory


    Next, a relationship generator component derives meaningful connections between these entities,
establishing a set of relationship triplets that capture the semantic structure of the information. This LLM-
based module analyzes the extracted entities and their context within the conversation to identify semantically
significant connections. It works by examining linguistic patterns, contextual cues, and domain knowledge to
determine how entities relate to one another. For each potential entity pair, the generator evaluates whether
a meaningful relationship exists and, if so, classifies this relationship with an appropriate label (e.g., ‘lives_in’,
‘prefers’, ‘owns’, ‘happened_on’). The module employs prompt engineering techniques that guide the LLM
to reason about both explicit statements and implicit information in the dialogue, resulting in relationship
triplets that form the edges in our memory graph and enable complex reasoning across interconnected
                                                           g
information. When integrating new information, Mem0 employs a sophisticated storage and update strategy.
For each new relationship triple, we compute embeddings for both source and destination entities, then
search for existing nodes with semantic similarity above a defined threshold ‘t’. Based on node existence,
the system may create both nodes, create only one node, or use existing nodes before establishing the
relationship with appropriate metadata. To maintain a consistent knowledge graph, we implement a conflict
detection mechanism that identifies potentially conflicting existing relationships when new information
arrives. An LLM-based update resolver determines if certain relationships should be obsolete, marking them
as invalid rather than physically removing them to enable temporal reasoning.
                                                   g
    The memory retrieval functionality in Mem0 implements a dual-approach strategy for optimal information
access. The entity-centric method first identifies key entities within a query, then leverages semantic similarity
to locate corresponding nodes in the knowledge graph. It systematically explores both incoming and outgoing
relationships from these anchor nodes, constructing a comprehensive subgraph that captures relevant
contextual information. Complementing this, the semantic triplet approach takes a more holistic view by
encoding the entire query as a dense embedding vector. This query representation is then matched against
textual encodings of each relationship triplet in the knowledge graph. The system calculates fine-grained
similarity scores between the query and all available triplets, returning only those that exceed a configurable
                                                                                                              g
relevance threshold, ranked in order of decreasing similarity. This dual retrieval mechanism enables Mem0 to
handle both targeted entity-focused questions and broader conceptual queries with equal effectiveness.
                                                                          1
    From an implementation perspective, the system utilizes Neo4j as the underlying graph database. LLM-
based extractors and update module leverage GPT-4o-mini with function calling capabilities, allowing for
structured extraction of information from unstructured text. By combining graph-based representations with
                                                                    g
semantic embeddings and LLM-based information extraction, Mem0 achieves both the structural richness
needed for complex reasoning and the semantic flexibility required for natural language understanding.


3. Experimental Setup

3.1. Dataset

The LOCOMO (Maharana et al., 2024) dataset is designed to evaluate long-term conversational memory in
dialogue systems. It comprises 10 extended conversations, each containing approximately 600 dialogues and
26000 tokens on average, distributed across multiple sessions. Each conversation captures two individuals
discussing daily experiences or past events. Following these multi-session dialogues, each conversation is
accompanied by 200 questions on an average with corresponding ground truth answers. These questions
are categorized into multiple types: single-hop, multi-hop, temporal, and open-domain. The dataset
originally included an adversarial question category, which was designed to test systems’ ability to recognize

unanswerable questions. However, this category was excluded from our evaluation because ground truth
answers were unavailable, and the expected behavior for this question type is that the agent should recognize
them as unanswerable.


3.2. Evaluation Metrics

Our evaluation framework implements a comprehensive approach to assess long-term memory capabilities
in dialogue systems, considering both response quality and operational efficiency. We categorize our metrics
into two distinct groups that together provide a holistic understanding of system performance.


(1) Performance Metrics Previous research in conversational AI (Goswami, 2025, Soni et al., 2024, Singh
et al., 2020) has predominantly relied on lexical similarity metrics such as F1 Score (F1 ) and BLEU-1 (B1 ).
However, these metrics exhibit significant limitations when evaluating factual accuracy in conversational
contexts. Consider a scenario where the ground truth answer is ‘Alice was born in March’ and a system
generates ‘Alice is born in July.’ Despite containing a critical factual error regarding the birth month, traditional
metrics would assign relatively high scores due to lexical overlap in the remaining tokens (‘Alice,’ ‘born,’ etc.).
This fundamental limitation can lead to misleading evaluations that fail to capture semantic correctness.
To address these shortcomings, we use LLM-as-a-Judge (J) as a complementary evaluation metric. This
approach leverages a separate, more capable LLM to assess response quality across multiple dimensions,
including factual accuracy, relevance, completeness, and contextual appropriateness. The judge model
analyzes the question, ground truth answer and the generated answer, providing a more nuanced evaluation
that aligns better with human judgment. Due to the stochastic nature of J evaluations, we conducted 10
independent runs for each method on the entire dataset and report the mean scores along with ±1 standard
deviation. More details about the J is present in Appendix A.


(2) Deployment Metrics Beyond response quality, practical deployment considerations are crucial for real-
world applications of long-term memory in AI agents. We systematically track Token Consumption, using
‘cl100k_base’ encoding from tiktoken, measuring the number of tokens extracted during retrieval that
serve as context for answering queries. For our memory-based models, these tokens represent the memories
retrieved from the knowledge base, while for RAG-based models, they correspond to the total number of
tokens in the retrieved text chunks. This distinction is important as it directly affects operational costs and
system efficiency—whether processing concise memory facts or larger raw text segments. We further monitor
Latency, (i) search latency: which captures the total time required to search the memory (in memory-based
solutions) or chunk (in RAG-based solutions) and (ii) total latency: time to generate appropriate responses,
consisting of both retrieval time (accessing memories or chunks) and answer generation time using the LLM.
   The relationship between these metrics reveals important trade-offs in system design. For instance,
more sophisticated memory architectures might achieve higher factual accuracy but at the cost of increased
token consumption and latency. Our multi-dimensional evaluation methodology enables researchers and
practitioners to make informed decisions based on their specific requirements, whether prioritizing response
quality for critical applications or computational efficiency for real-time deployment scenarios.


3.3. Baselines

To comprehensively evaluate our approach, we compare against six distinct categories of baselines that
represent the current state of conversational memory systems. These diverse baselines collectively provide a

robust framework for evaluating the effectiveness of different memory architectures across various dimensions,
including factual accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability to extended conversations. Where
applicable, unless otherwise specified, we set the temperature to 0 to ensure the runs are as reproducible as
possible.


Established LOCOMO Benchmarks We first establish a comparative foundation by evaluating previously
benchmarked methods on the LOCOMO dataset. These include five established approaches: LoCoMo (Maha-
rana et al., 2024), ReadAgent (Lee et al., 2024), MemoryBank (Zhong et al., 2024), MemGPT (Packer et al.,
2023), and A-Mem (Xu et al., 2025). These established benchmarks not only provide direct comparison
points with published results but also represent the evolution of conversational memory architectures across
different algorithmic paradigms. For our evaluation, we select the metrics where gpt-4o-mini was used
for the evaluation. More details about these benchmarks are mentioned in Appendix C.


Open-Source Memory Solutions Our second category consists of promising open-source memory architec-
                       2
tures such as LangMem (Hot Path) that have demonstrated effectiveness in related conversational tasks but
have not yet been evaluated on the LOCOMO dataset. By adapting these systems to our evaluation framework,
we broaden the comparative landscape and identify potential alternative approaches that may offer competi-
tive performance. We initialized the LLM with gpt-4o-mini and used text-embedding-small-3 as the
embedding model.


Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) As a baseline, we treat the entire conversation history as a
document collection and apply a standard RAG pipeline. We first segment each conversation into fixed-length
chunks (128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, and 8192 tokens), where 8192 is the maximum chunk size
supported by our embedding model. All chunks are embedded using OpenAI’s text-embedding-small-3
to ensure consistent vector quality across configurations. At query time, we retrieve the top k chunks by
semantic similarity and concatenate them as context for answer generation. Throughout our experiments we
set k∈{1,2}: with k=1 only the single most relevant chunk is used, and with k=2 the two most relevant
chunks (up to 16384 tokens) are concatenated. We avoid k > 2 since the average conversation length (26000
tokens) would be fully covered, negating the benefits of selective retrieval. By varying chunk size and k, we
systematically evaluate RAG performance on long-term conversational memory tasks.


Full-Context Processing We adopt a straightforward approach by passing the entire conversation history
within the context window of the LLM. This method leverages the model’s inherent ability to process
sequential information without additional architectural components. While conceptually simple, this approach
faces practical limitations as conversation length increases, eventually increasing token cost and latency.
Nevertheless, it establishes an important reference point for understanding the value of more sophisticated
memory mechanisms compared to direct processing of available context.


Proprietary Models We evaluate OpenAI’s memory feature available in their ChatGPT interface, specifically
                                                        3

using gpt-4o-mini for consistency. We ingest entire LOCOMO conversations with a prompt (see Appendix A)
into single chat sessions, prompting memory generation with timestamps, participant names, and conversation

text. These generated memories are then used as complete context for answering questions about each
conversation, intentionally granting the OpenAI approach privileged access to all memories rather than
only question-relevant ones. This methodology accommodates the lack of external API access for selective
memory retrieval in OpenAI’s system for benchmarking.


Memory Providers We incorporate Zep (Rasmussen et al., 2025), a memory management platform designed
for AI agents. Using their platform version, we conduct systematic evaluations across the LOCOMO dataset,
maintaining temporal fidelity by preserving timestamp information alongside conversational content. This
temporal anchoring ensures that time-sensitive queries can be addressed through appropriately contextualized
memory retrieval, particularly important for evaluating questions that require chronological awareness.
This baseline represents an important commercial implementation of memory management specifically
engineered for AI agents.

                                                                                               g
Table 1 reports F1 , B1 and J scores for our two architectures—Mem0 and Mem0 —against a suite of competitive
baselines, as mentioned in Section 3, on single-hop, multi-hop, open-domain, and temporal questions. Overall,
both of our models set new state-of-the-art marks in all the three evaluation metrics for most question types.


Single-Hop Question Performance Single-hop queries involve locating a single factual span contained
within one dialogue turn. Leveraging its dense memories in natural language text, Mem0 secures the strongest
results:F1 =38.72, B1 =27.13, and J=67.13. Augmenting the natural language memories with graph memory
       g
(Mem0 ) yields marginal performance drop compared to Mem0, indicating that relational structure provides
limited utility when the retrieval target occupies a single turn. Among the existing baselines, the full-context
OpenAI run attains the next-best J score, reflecting the benefits of retaining the entire conversation in context,
while LangMem and Zep both score around 8% relatively less against our models on J score. Previous LOCOMO

                       Mem0: Building Production-Ready AI Agents with Scalable Long-Term Memory


benchmarks such as A-mem lag by more than 25 points in J, underscoring the necessity of fine-grained,
structured memory indexing even for simple retrieval tasks.


Multi-Hop Question Performance Multi-hop queries require synthesizing information dispersed across
multiple conversation sessions, posing significant challenges in memory integration and retrieval. Mem0 clearly
outperforms other methods with an F1 score of 28.64 and a J score of 51.15, reflecting its capability to
efficiently retrieve and integrate disparate information stored across sessions. Interestingly, the addition
                             g
of graph memory in Mem0 does not provide performance gains here, indicating potential inefficiencies
or redundancies in structured graph representations for complex integrative tasks compared to dense
natural language memory alone. Baselines like LangMem show competitive performances, but their scores
substantially trail those of Mem0, emphasizing the advantage of our refined memory indexing and retrieval
mechanisms for complex query processing.


Open-Domain Performance In open-domain settings, the baseline Zep achieves the highest F1 (49.56) and
J (76.60) scores, edging out our methods by a narrow margin. In particular, Zep’s J score of 76.60 surpasses
Mem0g ’s 75.71 by just 0.89 percentage points and outperforms Mem0’s 72.93 by 3.67 points, highlighting a
                                                                                                        g
consistent, if slight, advantage in integrating conversational memory with external knowledge. Mem0 remains
a strong runner-up, with a J of 75.71 reflecting high factual retrieval precision, while Mem0 follows with 72.93,
demonstrating robust coherence. These results underscore that although structured relational memories (as
                      g
in Mem0 and Mem0 ) substantially improve open-domain retrieval, Zep maintains a small but meaningful
lead.


Temporal Reasoning Performance Temporal reasoning tasks hinge on accurate modeling of event se-
quences, their relative ordering, and durations within conversational history. Our architectures demonstrate
                                                          g
substantial improvements across all metrics, with Mem0 achieving the highest F1 (51.55) and J (58.13),
suggesting that structured relational representations in addition to natural language memories significantly
aid in temporally grounded judgments. Notably, the base variant, Mem0, also provide a decent J score (55.51),
suggesting that natural language alone can aid in temporally grounded judgments. Among baselines, OpenAI
notably underperforms, with scores below 15%, primarily due to missing timestamps in most generated
memories despite explicit prompting in the OpenAI ChatGPT to extract memories with timestamps. Other
baselines such as A-Mem achieve respectable results, yet our models clearly advance the state-of-the-art,
emphasizing the critical advantage of accurately leveraging both natural language contextualization and
structured graph representations for temporal reasoning.

4.2. Cross-Category Analysis

The comprehensive evaluation across diverse question categories reveals that our proposed architectures,
Mem0 and Mem0g , consistently achieve superior performance compared to baseline systems. For single-hop
queries, Mem0 demonstrates particularly strong performance, benefiting from its efficient dense natural
                                                                               g
language memory structure. Although graph-based representations in Mem0 slightly lag behind in lexical
overlap metrics for these simpler queries, they significantly enhance semantic coherence, as demonstrated
by competitive J scores. This indicates that graph structures are more beneficial in scenarios involving
nuanced relational context rather than straightforward retrieval. For multi-hop questions, Mem0 exhibits clear
advantages by effectively synthesizing dispersed information across multiple sessions, confirming that natural
language memories provide sufficient representational richness for these integrative tasks. Surprisingly, the

expected relational advantages of Mem0 do not translate into better outcomes here, suggesting potential
overhead or redundancy when navigating more intricate graph structures in multi-step reasoning scenarios.

    In temporal reasoning, Mem0 substantially outperforms other methods, validating that structured
relational graphs excel in capturing chronological relationships and event sequences. The presence of explicit
                                               g
relational context significantly enhances Mem0 ’s temporal coherence, outperforming Mem0’s dense memory
storage and highlighting the importance of precise relational representations when tracking temporally
                                                                                                            g
sensitive information. Open-domain performance further reinforces the value of relational modeling. Mem0 ,
benefiting from the relational clarity of graph-based memory, closely competes with the top-performing

through relational clarity, suggesting an optimal synergy between structured memory and open-domain
information synthesis.

    Overall, our analysis indicates complementary strengths of Mem0 and Mem0 across various task demands:
dense, natural-language-based memory offers significant efficiency for simpler queries, while explicit rela-
tional modeling becomes essential for tasks demanding nuanced temporal and contextual integration. These
findings reinforce the importance of adaptable memory structures tailored to specific reasoning contexts in
AI agent deployments.

4.3. Performance Comparison of Mem0 and Mem0 Against RAG Approaches and Full-Context Model
                                                                                                 g
Comparisons in Table 2, focusing on the ‘Overall J’ column, reveal that both Mem0 and Mem0 consistently
outperform all RAG configurations, which vary chunk sizes (128–8192 tokens) and retrieve either one (k=1)
or two (k=2) chunks. Even the strongest RAG approach peaks at around 61% in the J metric, whereas
Mem0 reaches 67%—about a 10% relative improvement—and Mem0g reaches over 68%, achieving around
a 12% relative gain. These advances underscore the advantage of capturing only the most salient facts in
memory, rather than retrieving large chunk of original text. By converting the conversation history into
                                                     g
concise, structured representations, Mem0 and Mem0 mitigate noise and surface more precise cues to the
LLM, leading to better answers as evaluated by an external LLM (J).
    Despite these improvements, a full-context method that ingests a chunk of roughly 26,000 tokens still
achieves the highest J score (approximately 73%). However, as shown in Figure 4b, it also incurs a very
high total p95 latency—around 17 seconds—since the model must read the entire conversation on every
                                   g
query. By contrast, Mem0 and Mem0 significantly reduce token usage and thus achieve lower p95 latencies of
around 1.44 seconds (a 92% reduction) and 2.6 seconds (a 85% reduction), respectively over full-context
approach. Although the full-context approach can provide a slight accuracy edge, the memory-based systems
offer a more practical trade-off, maintaining near-competitive quality while imposing only a fraction of the
token and latency cost. As conversation length increases, full-context approaches suffer from exponential
growth in computational overhead (evident in Table 2 where total p95 latency increases significantly with
larger k values or chunk sizes). This increase in input chunks leads to longer response times and higher
                                                                                      g
token consumption costs. In contrast, memory-focused approaches like Mem0 and Mem0 maintain consistent
performance regardless of conversation length, making them substantially more viable for production-scale
deployments where efficiency and responsiveness are critical.


4.4. Latency Analysis

Table 2 provides a comprehensive performance comparison of various retrieval and memory methodologies,
presenting median (p50) and tail (p95) latencies for both the search phase and total response generation
across the LOCOMO dataset. Our analysis reveals distinct performance patterns governed by architectural
choices. Memory-centric architectures demonstrate different performance characteristics. A-Mem, despite its
larger memory store, incurs substantial search overhead (p50: 0.668s), resulting in total median latencies of
1.410s. LangMem exhibits even higher search latencies (p50: 17.99s, p95: 59.82s), rendering it impractical
for interactive applications. Zep achieves moderate performance (p50 total: 1.292s). The full-context
baseline, which processes the entire conversation history without retrieval, fundamentally differs from
retrieval-based approaches. By passing the entire conversation context (26000 tokens) directly to the LLM, it
eliminates search overhead but incurs extreme total latencies (p50: 9.870s, p95: 17.117s). Similarly, the
OpenAI implementation does not perform memory search, as it processes manually extracted memories from
their playground. While this approach achieves impressive response generation times (p50: 0.466s, p95:
0.889s), it requires pre-extraction of relevant context, which is not reflected in the reported metrics.
   Our proposed Mem0 approach achieves the lowest search latency among all methods (p50: 0.148s, p95:
0.200s) as illustrated in Figure 4a. This efficiency stems from our selective memory retrieval mechanism
and infra improvements that dynamically identifies and retrieves only the most salient information rather
than fixed-size chunks. Consequently, Mem0 maintains the lowest total median latency (0.708s) with
remarkably contained p95 values (1.440s), making it particularly suitable for latency-sensitive applications
                                                         g
such as interactive AI agents. The graph-enhanced Mem0 variant introduces additional relational modeling
capabilities at a moderate latency cost, with search times (0.476s) still outperforming all existing memory

                                                      g
solutions and baselines. Despite this increase, Mem0 maintains competitive total latencies (p50: 1.091s, p95:
2.590s) while achieving the highest J score (68.44%) across all methods—trailing only the computationally
prohibitive full-context approach. This performance profile demonstrates our methods’ ability to balance
response quality and computational efficiency, offering a compelling solution for production AI agents where
both factors are critical constraints.


4.5. Memory System Overhead: Token Analysis and Construction Time

We measure the average token budget required to materialise each system’s long-term memory store.
Mem0 encodes complete dialogue turns in a natural language representation and therefore occupies only 7k
                                                         g
tokens per conversation on an average. Where as Mem0 roughly doubles the footprint to 14k tokens, due to
the introduction of graph memories which includes nodes and corresponding relationships. In stark contrast,
Zep’s memory graph consumes in excess of 600k tokens. The inflation arises from Zep’s design choice to
cache a full abstractive summary at every node while also storing facts on the connecting edges, leading
to extensive redundancy across the graph. For perspective, supplying the entire raw conversation context
to the language model—without any memory abstraction—amounts to roughly 26k tokens on average, 20
times less relative to Zep’s graph. Beyond token inefficiency, our experiments revealed significant operational
bottlenecks with Zep. After adding memories to Zep’s system, we observed that immediate memory retrieval
attempts often failed to answer our queries correctly. Interestingly, re-running identical searches after a
delay of several hours yielded considerably better results. This latency suggests that Zep’s graph construction
involves multiple asynchronous LLM calls and extensive background processing, making the memory system
impractical for real-time applications. In contrast, Mem0 graph construction completes in under a minute even
in worst-case scenarios, allowing users to immediately leverage newly added memories for query responses.
   These findings highlight that Zep not only replicates identical knowledge fragments across multiple
                                                                                            g
nodes, but also introduces significant operational delays. Our architectures—Mem0 and Mem0 —preserve the
same information at a fraction of the token cost and with substantially faster memory availability, offering a
more memory-efficient and operationally responsive representation.


5. Conclusion and Future Work
                                     g
We have introduced Mem0 and Mem0 , two complementary memory architectures that overcome the intrinsic
limitations of fixed context windows in LLMs. By dynamically extracting, consolidating, and retrieving
compact memory representations, Mem0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across single-hop and multi-hop
                       g
reasoning, while Mem0 ’s graph-based extensions unlock significant gains in temporal and open-domain tasks.
On the LOCOMO benchmark, our methods deliver 5%, 11%, and 7% relative improvements in single-hop,
temporal, and multi-hop reasoning question types over best performing methods in respective question
type and reduce p95 latency by over 91% compared to full-context baselines—demonstrating a powerful
balance between precision and responsiveness. Mem0’s dense memory pipeline excels at rapid retrieval
                                                                                                           g
for straightforward queries, minimizing token usage and computational overhead. In contrast, Mem0 ’s
structured graph representations provide nuanced relational clarity, enabling complex event sequencing
and rich context integration without sacrificing practical efficiency. Together, they form a versatile memory
toolkit that adapts to diverse conversational demands while remaining deployable at scale.
                                                                                                             g
    Future research directions include optimizing graph operations to reduce the latency overhead in Mem0 ,
exploring hierarchical memory architectures that blend efficiency with relational representation, and de-
veloping more sophisticated memory consolidation mechanisms inspired by human cognitive processes.

Additionally, extending our memory frameworks to domains beyond conversational scenarios, such as proce-
dural reasoning and multimodal interactions, would further validate their broader applicability. By addressing
the fundamental limitations of fixed context windows, our work represents a significant advancement toward
conversational AI systems capable of maintaining coherent, contextually rich interactions over extended
periods, much like their human counterparts.

A. Prompts
In developing our LLM-as-a-Judge prompt, we adapt elements from the prompt released by Packer et al.
(2023).

   Prompt Tem pl at e for L L M as a Ju d ge
   Your task is to label an answer to a question as "CORRECT" or "WRONG". You will be given
   the following data: (1) a question (posed by one user to another user), (2) a ‘gold’
   (ground truth) answer, (3) a generated answer which you will score as CORRECT/WRONG.

  The point of the question is to ask about something one user should know about the other
  user based on their prior conversations. The gold answer will usually be a concise and
  short answer that includes the referenced topic, for example:
  Question: Do you remember what I got the last time I went to Hawaii?
  Gold answer: A shell necklace
  The generated answer might be much longer, but you should be generous with your grading
  - as long as it touches on the same topic as the gold answer, it should be counted as
  CORRECT.

   For time related questions, the gold answer will be a specific date, month, year, etc. The
   generated answer might be much longer or use relative time references (like ‘last Tuesday’
   or ‘next month’), but you should be generous with your grading - as long as it refers to
   the same date or time period as the gold answer, it should be counted as CORRECT. Even if
   the format differs (e.g., ‘May 7th’ vs ‘7 May’), consider it CORRECT if it’s the same date.

   Now it’s time for the real question:
   Question: {question}
   Gold answer: {gold_answer}
   Generated answer: {generated_answer}

   First, provide a short (one sentence) explanation of your reasoning, then finish with
   CORRECT or WRONG. Do NOT include both CORRECT and WRONG in your response, or it will break
   the evaluation script.

   Just return the label CORRECT or WRONG in a json format with the key as "label".

You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from
conversation memories.

# CONTEXT:

You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain
timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.

# INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers
2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer
3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the
memories
4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory
5. If there is a question about time references (like "last year", "two months ago",
etc.), calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory
from 4 May 2022 mentions "went to India last year," then the trip occurred in 2021.
6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For
example, convert "last year" to "2022" or "two months ago" to "March 2023" based on the
memory timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.
7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character
names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.
8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.

C. Selected Baselines
LoCoMo The LoCoMo framework implements a sophisticated memory pipeline that enables LLM agents to
maintain coherent, long-term conversations. At its core, the system divides memory into short-term and
long-term components. After each conversation session, agents generate summaries (stored as short-term
memory) that distill key information from that interaction. Simultaneously, individual conversation turns are


                                                         21

transformed into ‘observations’ - factual statements about each speaker’s persona and life events that are
stored in long-term memory with references to the specific dialog turns that produced them. When generating
new responses, agents leverage both the most recent session summary and selectively retrieve relevant
observations from their long-term memory. This dual-memory approach is further enhanced by incorporating
a temporal event graph that tracks causally connected life events occurring between conversation sessions.
By conditioning responses on retrieved memories, current conversation context, persona information, and
intervening life events, the system enables agents to maintain consistent personalities and recall important
details across conversations spanning hundreds of turns and dozens of sessions.


ReadAgent ReadAgent addresses the fundamental limitations of LLMs by emulating how humans process
lengthy texts through a sophisticated three-stage pipeline. First, in Episode Pagination, the system intelligently
segments text at natural cognitive boundaries rather than arbitrary cutoffs. Next, during Memory Gisting,
it distills each segment into concise summaries that preserve essential meaning while drastically reducing
token count—similar to how human memory retains the substance of information without verbatim recall.
Finally, when tasked with answering questions, the Interactive Lookup mechanism examines these gists
and strategically retrieves only the most relevant original text segments for detailed processing. This
human-inspired approach enables LLMs to effectively manage documents up to 20 times longer than their
normal context windows. By balancing global understanding through gists with selective attention to
details, ReadAgent achieves both computational efficiency and improved comprehension, demonstrating that
mimicking human cognitive processes can significantly enhance AI text processing capabilities.


MemoryBank The MemoryBank system enhances LLMs with long-term memory through a sophisticated
three-part pipeline. At its core, the Memory Storage component warehouses detailed conversation logs,
hierarchical event summaries, and evolving user personality profiles. When a new interaction occurs, the
Memory Retrieval mechanism employs a dual-tower dense retrieval model to extract contextually relevant
past information. The Memory Updating component, provides a human-like forgetting mechanism where
memories strengthen when recalled and naturally decay over time if unused. This comprehensive approach
enables AI companions to recall pertinent information, maintain contextual awareness across extended
interactions, and develop increasingly accurate user portraits, resulting in more personalized and natural
long-term conversations.


MemGPT The MemGPT system introduces an operating system-inspired approach to overcome the context
window limitations inherent in LLMs. At its core, MemGPT employs a sophisticated memory management
pipeline consisting of three key components: a hierarchical memory system, self-directed memory operations,
and an event-based control flow mechanism. The system divides available memory into ‘main context’
(analogous to RAM in traditional operating systems) and ‘external context’ (analogous to disk storage).
The main context—which is bound by the LLM’s context window—contains system instructions, recent
conversation history, and working memory that can be modified by the model. The external context stores
unlimited information outside the model’s immediate context window, including complete conversation
histories and archival data. When the LLM needs information not present in main context, it can initiate
function calls to search, retrieve, or modify content across these memory tiers, effectively ‘paging’ relevant
information in and out of its limited context window. This OS-inspired architecture enables MemGPT to
maintain conversational coherence over extended interactions, manage documents that exceed standard
context limits, and perform multi-hop information retrieval tasks—all while operating with fixed-context


                                                         22

models. The system’s ability to intelligently manage its own memory resources provides the illusion of
infinite context, significantly extending what’s possible with current LLM technology.


A-Mem The A-Mem model introduces an agentic memory system designed for LLM agents. This system
dynamically structures and evolves memories through interconnected notes. Each note captures interactions
enriched with structured attributes like keywords, contextual descriptions, and tags generated by the
LLM. Upon creating a new memory, A-MEM uses semantic embeddings to retrieve relevant existing notes,
then employs an LLM-driven approach to establish meaningful links based on similarities and shared
attributes. Crucially, the memory evolution mechanism updates existing notes dynamically, refining their
contextual information and attributes whenever new relevant memories are integrated. Thus, memory
structure continually evolves, allowing richer and contextually deeper connections among memories. Retrieval
from memory is conducted through semantic similarity, providing relevant historical context during agent
interactions
