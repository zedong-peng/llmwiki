                                                     Recent large language model (LLM)-driven chat assistant systems have integrated
                                                     memory components to track user-assistant chat histories, enabling more accurate
                                                     and personalized responses. However, their long-term memory capabilities in
                                                     sustained interactions remain underexplored. We introduce L ONG M EM E VAL,
                                                     a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate five core long-term memory
                                                     abilities of chat assistants: information extraction, multi-session reasoning,
                                                     temporal reasoning, knowledge updates, and abstention. With 500 meticulously
                                                     curated questions embedded within freely scalable user-assistant chat histories,
                                                     L ONG M EM E VAL presents a significant challenge to existing long-term memory
                                                     systems, with commercial chat assistants and long-context LLMs showing a 30%
                                                     accuracy drop on memorizing information across sustained interactions. We
                                                     then present a unified framework that breaks down the long-term memory design
                                                     into three stages: indexing, retrieval, and reading. Built upon key experimental
                                                     insights, we propose several memory design optimizations including session
                                                     decomposition for value granularity, fact-augmented key expansion for indexing,
                                                     and time-aware query expansion for refining the search scope. Extensive exper-
                                                     iments show that these optimizations greatly improve both memory recall and

                                                     valuable resources and guidance for advancing the long-term memory capabilities
                                                     of LLM-based chat assistants, paving the way toward more personalized and

                                        Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities in solving diverse tasks
                                        through natural language, leading to numerous successful chat assistant applications (OpenAI,
                                        2022; Microsoft, 2023). Nevertheless, LLMs face limitations on tasks relying heavily on personal
                                        knowledge accumulated through long-term user-AI interactions, such as psychological counseling
                                        or secretarial duties (Zhong et al., 2024). Failing to incorporate user background and preferences
                                        into responses can diminish the response’s accuracy as well as user satisfaction. To personalize
                                        LLM-based assistants, long-term memory, the ability to memorize, recall, and reason with a long
                                        interaction history, is indispensable. Recently, several commercial (OpenAI, 2024; Coze, 2024)
                                        and open-source assistant systems with memory (Zhong et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024) have been
                                        introduced. These systems leverage techniques like compressing, indexing, and retrieving from chat
                                        histories to generate more accurate and personalized responses.
                                        Despite these advances, there has been limited progress in holistically evaluating the memory
                                        capability in long-term interactions. While several benchmarks evaluate LLMs on understanding
                                        long chat histories (Xu et al., 2022a;b; Zhong et al., 2024; Maharana et al., 2024; Du et al., 2024;
                                        Kim et al., 2024), they have two major shortcomings. First, they do not accurately reflect user-AI
                                        interactions: many focus solely on human-human conversations (Xu et al., 2022a; Maharana et al.,
                                        2024; Kim et al., 2024), while others omit task-oriented dialogues, which represent a significant

portion of chat assistant usage and challenge memorization with the long-context inputs and long-
form responses. Their interactive histories also typically have a non-configurable length spanning
only a few thousand tokens, limiting the difficulty as current systems continue to improve. Second,
current benchmarks’ questions only offer a limited coverage of the memory abilities required in
dynamic long-term interactions. For instance, MemoryBank (Zhong et al., 2024) and PerLTQA (Du
et al., 2024) insufficiently evaluate the ability to synthesize information across numerous sessions or
to reason with temporal metadata or time references. All long-term memory benchmarks including
recent ones such as LoCoMo (Maharana et al., 2024) also fail to evaluate recall of information
provided by the assistant or reasoning with updated user information.
We introduce L ONG M EM E VAL, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing the long-term memory
capabilities of chat assistants. L ONG M EM E VAL consists of 500 manually created questions to test
five core memory abilities: information extraction, multi-session reasoning, temporal reasoning,
knowledge updates, and abstention. Each question requires recalling information hidden within
one or more task-oriented dialogues between a user and an assistant. Inspired by the “needle-
in-a-haystack” test (Kamradt, 2023), we design a pipeline to compile a coherent and length-
configurable chat history for each question. A chat system, then, is required to parse the
dynamic interactions online for memorization, and answer the question after all the interaction
sessions. While the length of the history is freely extensible, we provide two standard settings
for consistent comparison: L ONG M EM E VAL S with approximately 115k tokens per problem and
L ONG M EM E VAL M with 500 sessions (around 1.5 million tokens). Preliminary evaluations highlight
the difficulty of L ONG M EM E VAL, as long-context LLMs show a 30%∼60% performance drop on
L ONG M EM E VAL S , and manual evaluations reveal that state-of-the-art commercial systems only
achieved 30%∼70% accuracy in a setting much simpler than L ONG M EM E VAL S (§3.4).
Finally, we present a unified view for memory-augmented chat assistants. Leveraging L ONG -
M EM E VAL, we comprehensively analyze memory design choices across three key execution
stages—indexing, retrieval, and reading—and four control points: value, key, query, and reading
strategy. Experimental insights identify several effective memory designs:

       • (§5.2) Instead of sessions, round is the more optimal granularity for storing and utilizing
         the interactive history. While further compression into individual user facts harms overall
         performance due to information loss, it improves the multi-session reasoning accuracy.
       • (§5.3) While using a flat index with the memory values themselves as the keys is a strong
         baseline, further expanding the keys with extracted user facts improves both memory recall
         (9.4% higher recall@k) and downstream question answering (5.4% higher accuracy).
       • (§5.4) Naive time-agnostic memory designs perform poorly on temporal reasoning ques-
         tions. We propose a simple indexing and query expansion strategy to explicitly associate
         timestamps with facts and narrow down the search range, improving the memory recall for
         temporal reasoning by 6.8%∼11.3% when a strong LLM is employed for query expansion.
       • (§5.5) Even with perfect memory recall, accurately utilizing retrieved items is non-trivial.
         Applying Chain-of-Note (Yu et al., 2023) and structured data format (Yin et al., 2023)
         improves question answering accuracy by as much as 10 absolute points across three LLMs.

Long-Term Dialogue Benchmarks As the ability of dialogue systems improve, research starts
to focus on long-term dialogue understanding beyond traditional dialogue modeling benchmarks
(Budzianowski et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2018). Early works focused on language modeling evaluation
on generating personalized responses from human-human (Xu et al., 2022a) or human-AI (Xu
et al., 2022b) chat histories. To more precisely evaluate memory accuracy, subsequent benchmarks
shifted toward question answering (QA, Reddy et al. (2019); Zhang & Choi (2021)). For example,
MemoryBank (Zhong et al., 2024) features multi-day chat histories from 15 users with 194 human-
written probing questions. LoCoMo (Maharana et al., 2024) includes 50 long-term chat histories and
questions testing single-hop, multi-hop, temporal, commonsense, world knowledge, and adversarial
reasoning. PerLTQA (Du et al., 2024) scales the evaluation to 3,409 dialogues and 8,593 questions,
covering world knowledge, personal profiles, social relationships, events, and dialogue history.
DialSim (Kim et al., 2024) evaluates models’ memory ability by roleplaying TV show characters

and introduces a time constraint that penalizes slow system responses. Despite these advancements,
existing QA-based benchmarks overlook several memory capabilities critical to long-term user-
assistant interactions: synthesizing information across numerous sessions, recalling assistant side
information, and reasoning about updated user details or complex temporal references. Additionally,
the chat histories are often too brief and do not reflect the nature of task-oriented interactions. Table 1
compares between L ONG M EM E VAL and previous works, highlighting its advantages in both (1)
featuring a long and freely extensible iterative history and (2) holistically covering critical memory
abilities in a uniquely challenging way (further examples in Figure 1).

Long-Term Memory Methods To equip chat assistants with long-term memory capabilities, three
major techniques are commonly explored. The first approach involves directly adapting LLMs to
process extensive history information as long-context inputs (Beltagy et al., 2020; Kitaev et al.,
2020; Fu et al., 2024; An et al., 2024). While this method avoids the need for complex architectures,
it is inefficient and susceptible to the “lost-in-the-middle” phenomenon, where the ability of LLMs
to utilize contextual information weakens as the input length grows (Shi et al., 2023; Liu et al.,
2024). A second line of research integrates differentiable memory modules into language models,
proposing specialized architectural designs and training strategies to enhance memory capabilities
(Weston et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023). Lastly, several studies
approach long-term memory from the perspective of context compression, developing techniques


                                                                                3

to condense lengthy histories into compact representations, whether in the form of LLM internal
representations (Mu et al., 2023; Chevalier et al., 2023), discrete tokens (Jiang et al., 2023; Xu et al.,
2024), or retrievable text segments via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG, Shi et al. (2024);
Wang et al. (2023); Sarthi et al. (2024); Chen et al. (2023a); Gutiérrez et al. (2024)). Although
L ONG M EM E VAL can evaluate any memory system, we will take an online context compression
perspective, where each history interaction session is sequentially processed, stored, and accessed
on-demand through indexing and retrieval mechanisms (§4). This formulation aligns with current
literature (Zhong et al., 2024; Gutiérrez et al., 2024) and commercial systems (OpenAI, 2024; Coze,
2024). Its plug-and-play nature also facilitates the integration into existing chat assistant systems.

3.1       P ROBLEM F ORMULATION

The evaluation of L ONG M EM E VAL requires an instance of 4-tuple (S, q, tq , a).                 S ≡
[(t1 , S1 ), (t2 , S2 ), ..., (tN , SN )] is a sequence of N history chat sessions ordered from the
earliest to the latest, where Si is a multi-turn interaction between the user and a chat assistant and ti
is the session’s timestamp. Each session can be further decomposed into rounds: one user message
followed by one assistant response. During test time, S is provided to the system one by one. q and
tq > tN represent the question from the user and its date. a is a short phrase indicating the answer,
or a natural language rubric describing the preferred answer in the case where q is open-ended.

3.2       L ONG M EM E VAL : B ENCHMARK C URATION

One major challenge in building a reliable personalized assistant is performing online recording, re-
calling, updating, and reasoning on the dynamically evolving user information. To comprehensively
reflect the challenge, L ONG M EM E VAL formulates five core long-term memory abilities:

           • Information Extraction (IE): Ability to recall specific information from extensive
             interactive histories, including the details mentioned by either the user or the assistant.
           • Multi-Session Reasoning (MR): Ability to synthesize the information across multiple
             history sessions to answer complex questions that involve aggregation and comparison.
           • Knowledge Updates (KU): Ability to recognize the changes in the user’s personal
             information and update the knowledge of the user dynamically over time.
           • Temporal Reasoning (TR): Awareness of the temporal aspects of user information,
             including both explicit time mentions and timestamp metadata in the interactions.
           • Abstention (ABS): Ability to identify questions seeking unknown information, i.e.,
             information not mentioned by the user in the interaction history, and answer “I don’t know”.

As shown in Table 1, this formulation represents a more comprehensive ability coverage compared
to prior long-term memory benchmarks like MemoryBank and PerLTQA. To thoroughly assess these
abilities, L ONG M EM E VAL features seven question types. Single-session-user and single-session-
assistant test memorizing the information mentioned by user or assistant within a single session.
Single-session-preference tests whether the model can utilize the user information to generate a
personalized response. multi-session (MR) tests aggregating user information across two or more
sessions. knowledge-update (KU) focuses on the ability to recognize changes in the user’s life
states and update the memory accordingly. temporal-reasoning (TR) tests reasoning with both
the timestamp in metadata and explicit time references. Finally, we draw 30 questions from the
previous question types and modify them into “false premise” questions, testing whether the model
can correctly abstain from answering (ABS). Figure 1 presents an example for each question type.

Question Curation Figure 2 depicts the question curation pipeline. We define an ontology of
164 user attributes in five categories: lifestyle, belongings, life events, situations context, and
demographic information. For each attribute, we leverage an LLM1 to generate attribute-focused
user background paragraphs, each of which includes detailed discussion of the user’s life experience.

Figure 2: Data creation pipeline of L ONG M EM E VAL. (a) Human experts construct all the questions
and evidence statements. (b) Then, the evidence sessions are LLM-simulated and human-edited. (c)
The full user-AI chat history is constructed at test time, whose length is freely configurable.
To create a question, we randomly sample a paragraph and use an LLM to propose several seed
(question, answer) pairs. As these LLM-proposed questions often lack depth and diversity, human
experts manually filter and rewrite all the questions to achieve the desired difficulty. Then, we
manually decompose the answer into one or more evidence statements with optional timestamps.

Evidence Session Construction Each evidence statement is then separately embedded into a task-
oriented evidence session created by self-chatting (Xu et al., 2023). The user LLM is instructed to
convey the evidence statement indirectly, e.g., instead of stating “I bought a new car last month,” it
might instead ask for help about car insurance and reveal the information incidentally. This approach
enhances the benchmark’s difficulty by requiring systems to recognize and memorize user details
not explicitly emphasized in conversations. We present the full details in Appendix A.1.
To ensure the data quality, all the evidence sessions are then manually screened and edited to
(1) verify evidence inclusion, (2) distribute the evidence statement across different conversation
positions, and (3) rephrase statements into more natural, colloquial language, especially for time
mentions, which LLMs often express too formally. We also meticulously annotate the position of
the evidence statement within each evidence session. For questions involving temporal information,
we then manually add timestamps to both the evidence sessions and the questions. Most questions
require evidence from multiple sessions (up to six) with evidence statements positioned diversely
within sessions. Appendix A.3 presents further statistics of the final constructed data.

History Compilation For each question, L ONG M EM E VAL compiles a coherent user-AI chat
history (Figure 2c). Our approach is analogous to the needle-in-a-haystack test (Kamradt, 2023),
which asks a model to retrieve brief information (the “needle”) embedded in a long document
(the “haystack”). In comparison, L ONG M EM E VAL is more challenging and realistic as it involves
retrieving and synthesizing information from multiple extended evidence sessions. Specifically, we
sample a number of unrelated user-AI chat sessions, randomly insert the evidence sessions in the
middle, and assign a plausible timestamp to all sessions. We draw the irrelevant sessions from two
sources: (1) self-chat sessions simulated based on other non-conflicting attributes and (2) publicly
released user-AI style chat data including ShareGPT (Zheng et al., 2023) and UltraChat (Ding et al.,
2023). This design creates extensible realistic chat histories with minimal conflicts. While the
pipeline allows us to compile chat histories of arbitrary length, we provide two standard settings:
L ONG M EM E VAL S (∼115k tokens/question) and L ONG M EM E VAL M (500 sessions, ∼1.5M tokens).

employs a LLM to assess response quality (Liu et al., 2023). Specifically, we prompt-engineer
the gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model via the OpenAI API. Our meta-evaluation study demonstrates
that the evaluator achieves more than 97% agreement with human experts. The prompts for each
problem type as well as the human meta-evaluation details are presented in Appendix A.4.

Memory Recall As L ONG M EM E VAL contains human-annotated answer location labels, interme-
diate retrieval metrics can be easily calculated if the chat system exposes its retrieval results. We
report Recall@k and NDCG@k, where k is the number of top items retrieved by the system.

3.4      L ONG M EM E VAL REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE

Using L ONG M EM E VAL, we conduct a pilot study on commercial systems and long-context LLMs.

Commercial systems We evaluate two commercial systems that maintain a set of memorized
user facts as the user chats with the assistant: ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024) and Coze (Coze, 2024).
Since these systems only support memory features via their web interfaces, we randomly selected
97 questions and created a short chat history of 3-6 sessions (approximately 10x shorter than
L ONG M EM E VAL S ). Human annotators interacted with the chat assistants session-by-session and
turn-by-turn, and finally ask the question in a new session2 . In Figure 3a, we compare this online
memory evaluation with offline reading, where GPT-4o is prompted to answer with the complete
history provided as context. Both ChatGPT and Coze exhibited significant performance drops
compared to offline reading, underscoring the challenging nature of L ONG M EM E VAL. We found
ChatGPT tended to overwrite crucial information as the chat continues, while Coze often failed
to record indirectly provided user information. We provide analyses in Appendix B. Overall, this
result highlights the gap between building a seemingly personalized chat assistant by recalling
isolated facts and demonstrating a genuinely strong memory ability.

Long-Context LLMs While L ONG M EM E VAL poses a significant challenge to online memory
systems, is the benchmark easily tackled with offline reading over the entire history? In Figure 3b,
we evaluated four advanced long-context LLMs on L ONG M EM E VAL S (with a history length of
approximately 115k tokens): GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024), and Phi-3 (Abdin
et al., 2024a). Compared to the oracle retrieval setting (answering with only the evidence sessions as
the context), these LLMs showed a 30% to 60% performance decline when tasked with reading the
entire L ONG M EM E VAL S history, regardless of whether the chain-of-note technique (Yu et al., 2023)
was applied (discussed further in §4.2). As the histories in L ONG M EM E VAL S is still short (∼50
sessions), the performance is likely to further degrade as the interaction history expands. Overall,
these findings suggest that even the most capable current long-context LLMs struggle to manage
an ever-growing interaction history without an effective memory mechanism.

       All evaluations were conducted in the first two weeks of August 2024.

4     A U NIFIED V IEW OF L ONG -T ERM M EMORY A SSISTANTS
In this section, we formulate a three-stage long-term memory model for chat assistants. Despite its
simplicity, this model provides a unified view of existing long-term memory assistant works. Along
each of its stages, we then investigate crucial control points and propose our optimizations.

4.1     L ONG -T ERM M EMORY S YSTEM : F ORMULATION

We formulate long-term memory as a massive key-value datastore [(k1 , v1 ), (k2 , v2 ), ...]. The keys
ki can be heterogeneous, and could be discrete or continuous. In the discrete case, the key could
be a sentence, a paragraph, a fact, or an entity, etc. In the continuous case, the key could be e.g.,
the model’s internal representation under some inputs. The values vi might repeat. As shown in
Figure 4, we formulate three stages for a memory-augmented assistant: (1) indexing, converting
each history session (ti , Si ) into one or more key-value items, (2) retrieval, formulating a retrieval
query and collecting k most relevant items, and (3) reading, an LLM M reads the retrieval result and
generates a response. In Table 2, we show how nine memory-augmented chat assistant systems can
be viewed as instantiations of this framework. An alternative mathematical formulation is presented
in Appendix C. For its conciseness, the rest of this paper follows this section’s formulation.

4.2     L ONG -T ERM M EMORY S YSTEM : D ESIGN C HOICES

We identify four crucial control points for long-term memory of chat assistants, as illustrated in
Figure 4. We analyze design choices from existing works and their limitations, and propose our
optimizations. Due to space constraints, we present these designs at a high level here, with detailed
designs further described in §5 and Appendix D.

CP 1: Value The value represents the format and granularity of each session stored in memory.
Given that user-AI chat sessions are often lengthy and cover multiple topics, storing each session
as a single item can hinder effective retrieval and reading. Conversely, compressing sessions into
summaries or user-specific facts, as seen in prior work such as Zhong et al. (2024) and Du et al.
(2024), can lead to information loss, harming the performance of the system to answer detailed
questions. In §5.2, we compare three value representation strategies: storing entire sessions,
decomposing sessions into individual rounds, and further applying summary/fact extraction.

CP 2: Key Even when sessions are decomposed and compressed, each item still contains
substantial information, with only a fraction relevant to the user’s query. Therefore, using the value
itself as the key, a common practice in prior works (Zhong et al., 2024; Maharana et al., 2024), may
be suboptimal. We introduce a key expansion approach in §5.3, where summaries, keyphrases, user
facts, and timestamped events are extracted from the values to augment the index. This optimization
highlights the key information and enables effective retrieval with multiple pathways.

CP 3: Query For straightforward user queries, the aforementioned key-value optimizations may
yield high retrieval accuracy. However, when queries involve temporal references (e.g., “Which
restaurant did you recommend last weekend?”), naive similarity search proves insufficient. We
address this with a time-aware indexing and query expansion strategy, where values are indexed
with timestamped events, and retrieval is restricted to items within the relevant time range (§5.4).

CP 4: Reading Strategy Answering complex queries may require recalling numerous memory
items. Although the retrieval accuracy can be enhanced through the preceding designs, it does not
guarantee that the LLM can effectively reason over the extensive context (Shi et al., 2023; Liu et al.,
2024). In §5.5, we explore reading strategies and demonstrate that optimizations such as extracting
key information before answering (Chain-of-Note, (Yu et al., 2023)) and using structured format
prompting (Yin et al., 2023) are crucial for achieving high reading performance.

5.1            E XPERIMENTAL S ETUP

We mainly study three LLMs: GPT-4o, Llama 3.1 70B Instruct, and Llama 3.1 8B Instruct3 . For
the retriever, we choose dense retrieval with the 1.5B Stella V5 model (Zhang, 2023), given its high
performance on MTEB (Muennighoff et al., 2023). Extensive comparisons between Stella V5 and
alternative retrievers are provided in Appendix E.2. For the indexing stage, we employ Llama 3.1
8B Instruct to extract summaries, keyphrases, user facts, and timestamped events. When sessions or
rounds are used as the key, we only keep the user-side utterances. In the reading stage, the retrieved
items are always sorted by their timestamp to help the reader model maintain temporal consistency.
Throughout §5.2 to §5.4, we apply Chain-of-Note and json format (discussed in §5.5) by default.

5.2            VALUE : D ECOMPOSITION IMPROVES RAG PERFORMANCE

Using L ONG M EM E VAL M , we compare different value choices in a budget-aware manner. As shown
in Figure 5, decomposing sessions into rounds significantly enhances reading performance with
GPT-4o as the reader, while performing similarly to non-decomposed sessions when using Llama
3.1 8B Instruct as the reader. However, despite their efficiency in token usage, replacing sessions
or rounds with extracted summaries or facts negatively impacts QA performance due to information
loss. The only exception is with multi-session reasoning questions, where fact decomposition
consistently improves performance. We hypothesize this is because fact decomposition extracts

the same type of information across all sessions in a more uniform and simplified format, aiding
retrieval and reading (Chen et al., 2023b). Finally, we observe that the optimal token budget varies
by the reader’s capability: while Llama 3.1 8B Instruct’s performance drops sharply beyond 3k
retrieved tokens, GPT-4o continues to improve even with over 20k retrieved tokens.

5.3   K EY: M ULTI - KEY INDEXING IMPROVES RETRIEVAL AND RAG

In Table 3, we explore whether summaries, keyphrases, or user facts condensed from the value can
serve as better keys than the value itself. Interestingly, despite their more focused semantics, using
these condensed forms alone does not enhance the memory recall performance. We hypothesize that
this is due to the retriever’s ability to already effectively handle long-text semantics.
To leverage both the highlighted information from compression and the completeness of the original
value, we applied a simple document expansion technique (Tao et al., 2006; Efron et al., 2012),
where the compressed information is concatenated with the original value to form the key during
indexing4 . This approach, particularly when using user facts, yielded an average improvement of
9.4% in recall@k and 5.4% in final accuracy across all models. In Appendix E.2, we further analyze
different retrievers and find with alternative retrievers, key expansion with summary and keyphrases
could improve Recall@5 when session is used as the value granularity. These results suggest that
multi-pathway retrieval can significantly enhance memory recall performance. In the following
section, we will investigate the time constraint as another pathway to leverage.

5.4   Q UERY: T IME - AWARE QUERY EXPANSION IMPROVES TEMPORAL REASONING

A key challenge highlighted by L ONG M EM E VAL in building real-world assistant systems is the
need to utilize temporal information present in both metadata and user utterances to correctly answer
time-sensitive queries. To address this need, we introduce a simple yet effective time-aware indexing
and query expansion scheme. Specifically, values are additionally indexed by the dates of the events
they contain. During retrieval, an LLM MT extracts a time range for time-sensitive queries, which
is used to filter out a large number of irrelevant values.
As shown in Table 4, this simple design improves recall by an average of 11.3% when using rounds
as the value and by 6.8% when using sessions as the value. This improvement remains consistent
when key expansion is applied during indexing. We also find that the effectiveness of this method
depends on using a strong LLM for MT to accurately infer time ranges from queries. Llama 8B, on
    4
      We also experimented with merging at the retrieval stage by combining the ranks from different pathways,
but it underperformed compared to indexing-stage merging. See Appendix E.3 for details.

the other hand, struggles to generate accurate time ranges, often hallucinating or missing temporal
cues even with numerous in-context examples. Further analysis is provided in Appendix E.4.

5.5       I MPROVING READING WITH CHAIN - OF - NOTE AND STRUCTURED FORMAT

As L ONG M EM E VAL requires syntheses across multiple sessions, even an optimal memory retrieval
mechanism needs to return a long context to capture all relevant information. To enhance the model’s
ability to handle long retrieved contexts, we apply two key optimizations. First, we present retrieved
items in a structured JSON format (Yin et al., 2023), which helps the model clearly recognize
memory items as the data for reading. Additionally, we apply the Chain-of-Note (CoN) reading
approach (Yu et al., 2023), instructing the LLM to first extract information from each memory item
and then reason based on these notes. This effectively decomposes long-context reading into two
simpler subtasks: copying important details and reasoning with more concise notes.
In Figure 6, we evaluate the reading designs under the oracle retrieval setting, where only evidence
sessions are provided. Surprisingly, even with perfect retrieval, a suboptimal reading strategy results
in up to a 10-point absolute performance drop compared to the best approach for GPT-4o. Notably,
when CoN is not applied, JSON format does not consistently outperform the natural language
format. However, with CoN, JSON format consistently benefits reader LLMs of various capabilities.
Appendix E.5 further analyzes error patterns of LLMs with the enhanced reading strategy.


6     C ONCLUSION

In this paper, we introduced L ONG M EM E VAL, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
designed to evaluate the long-term memory abilities of chat assistants across five core memory
tasks: information extraction, multi-session reasoning, temporal reasoning, knowledge updates,
and abstention. Through extensive experiments with both commercial systems and long-context
LLMs, we demonstrated the significant challenges posed by L ONG M EM E VAL, with current systems
exhibiting substantial performance drops. By analyzing key design choices across indexing,
retrieval, and reading stages, we proposed effective strategies such as session decomposition, fact-
augmented key expansion, and time-aware query expansion, which collectively improved both
memory recall and the question answering performance. Our findings highlight the need for more
sophisticated memory mechanisms to achieve personalized and reliable conversational AI, and
L ONG M EM E VAL offers a valuable benchmark to drive future advancements in long-term memory
capabilities for chat assistants.

R EPRODUCIBILITY S TATEMENT

In the paper writing and the subsequent code release, we are committed to enabling other researchers
to easily leverage our resources, replicate our results, and build upon our findings. We have
documented the benchmark construction process in detail in §3.2 and Appendix A.1, including
all the attributes and instructions used to prompt LLMs. We have created and will publicly release
the two fixed evaluation datasets, L ONG M EM E VAL S and L ONG M EM E VAL M . In addition, we will
also release the algorithm and source mixture used to create these two datasets, so that future
studies could build upon them to create chat histories of any length. Finally, we have meticulously
documented all the implementation details of our memory optimization in Appendix D, and our code
will be released along with the benchmark as well. We believe that these efforts for transparency
can help advance the field and foster future research endeavors.


E THICS S TATEMENT

The major artifact released by this work is the L ONG M EM E VAL evaluation dataset. To construct
the chat history, we utilize ShareGPT5 , which has an Apache 2.0 license, and UltraChat6 , which has
an MIT license. In the data release, we plan to use an MIT license. Since the questions and the
evidence sessions are newly created, we conducted a rigorous human screen process to ensure that
the new dataset does not contain personally identifiable information or offensive content. This paper
involves human annotators in two places: (1) the dataset construction and filtering (§3.2) and (2) the
manual analysis of commercial systems (§3.4). The process was mainly conducted by three expert
annotators, who are in-house NLP researchers that have more than three years of NLP research
experience. All the annotators are properly briefed with the annotation objective, and a discussion
among them is conducted to resolve uncertain cases. In total, approximately 400 human hours are
spent on the dataset construction and 150 hours on the study of commercial systems. The annotators
are paid biweekly or monthly, and their salaries include the working hours dedicated to annotation.
The data collection protocol has been determined exempt by the IRB of the author’s institution.
Finally, L ONG M EM E VAL and the studied memory system could induce several societal impacts.
Storing and recalling user information could cause personal information leakage, and the lack of
a memory “deletion” operator could harm the system’s trustworthiness. It is also possible that the
memory mechanism could be leveraged by malicious parties to toxic contents into the datastore,
which may cause a jailbreak behavior during inference. To mitigate such behaviors, it is essential
to implement moderation mechanisms that monitor the read/write data flow of the memory. We
encourage producers of memory-augmented assistant systems to be aware of these potential harmful
effects and apply thorough testing and mitigation.

A     S UPPLEMENTAL D ETAILS FOR L ONG M EM E VAL
A.1   DATASET C ONSTRUCTION

In this section, we discuss the details of our benchmark construction process.

Attribute Ontology In Table 5, we provide the full attribute ontology used in L ONG M EM E VAL.
This attribute ontology is constructed manually to reflect commonly mentioned topics in user-
assistant chats. Five major categories are included: demographic information, lifestyle, situational
context, life events, and belongings.

Table 5: Human-constructed user attribute ontology. Each attribute represents a unique dimension
of human experience along which a user biography could be constructed. For L ONG M EM E VAL, we
sample user backgrounds based on each of the attributes and construct questions on top of them.

Background Sampling Based on each of the attributes, we prompt Llama 3 70B Instruct to
generate a background paragraph outlining the user memory and experience. In our preliminary
studies, we find that the following zero-shot prompt in Figure 7 can already guide the model to
generate a long and focused user background with sufficient details, which suffices for the next step
of question creation. We thus use the same prompt for the final version of L ONG M EM E VAL.


                                                   17

    I will give you a topic. Please imagine you are a user that wants to recall and record recent
    personal facts along the topic. Generate a long text describing these personal facts. Use
    your imagination and generate the personal facts. Make it long and involve several recent
    facts or recent events spanning many days, weeks, or monthes. You may state the facts in
    plain language and no need to make it story-like.

    Topic: {attribute}

    Recent Personal Facts related to {attribute}:


          Figure 7: The prompt for constructing user backgrounds based on an attribute.


    I will give you a past memory. Use the memory to act as a normal user to chat with
    a chat assistant. In the chat, you may ask it to assist you various tasks or ask it about
    various information. However, make sure that your convey the following fact about you:
    ”{evidence statement}”. In addition, make sure your message is concise (1-2 simple
    sentences), since the real users often do not bother write a long message. I will provide
    you with the chat history and the response from the assistant. Directly generate the next
    response from the user’s perspective. You must simulate the tone of a neutral user and do
    not be overly enthusiastic, verbose, formal, or polite. For conciseness, DO NOT react to
    the assistant’s message with e.g., ”thanks” or ”I will do that”. Instead, directly state the
    follow-up questions or new questions.

    Memory: {background}

    Chat History:

    assistant: Hi! How can I assist you today?

    ... (more rounds as the conversation continues) ...


Figure 8: The prompt for instruction an LLM to act as a user and initiates a task-oriented dialogue
with another LLM. Both the background and the evidence statement is provided. This prompt is
used for the question type single-session. For the other question types, the prompt components are
slightly different but the prompt overall follows the same style.


Question Construction As discussed in §3.2, based on the generated user backgrounds, Llama
3 70B Instruct is used to propose question and answers for each question type. Additionally, for
the question type temporal-reasoning, multi-session reasoning, and single-session-preference,
we use GPT-4o to propose several questions. Nevertheless, we find most of the questions to be
unsatisfactory and manually filter and edit most of the questions. In total, approximately 1000
questions were generated for each question type, and the final yield rate is about 5%. For each
question, we then manually decompose the answer into the evidence statements. If the question
or the evidence statements involve time mentions, we assign a timestamp to the question and the
evidence statements at this stage. Note that if timestamps are specified for the evidence statements
at this stage, these timestamps will always be used for corresponding evidence sessions. Otherwise,
the timestamps will be randomly assigned at the history construction stage with all the other sessions.

Evidence Session Construction Using the question and the decomposed evidence statements, we
use Llama 3 70B Instruct to simulate one user-AI chat history per evidence statement via self-chat.
In Figure 8, we present an example of the chat simulation prompt, where we ask the user LLM to
indirectly mention the evidence statement while avoiding to talk about other evidence statements for
the question, if there are any. We include two crucial instructions in the prompt to make sure (1) the
evidence statement is provided in an indirect way and (2) the generated messages are concise and


                                                    18
Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025




thus mimic the style of user messages. On the assistant side, we directly provide the input generated
by the user LLM without any prompt engineering. We simulate the chat for 10 round at maximum
and stopped prematurely when either side of the LLMs generates an empty sequence indicating the
end of the conversation.
Subsequently, expert annotators manually inspect and edit each of the generated sessions to ensure
that (1) the required evidence statements are present in the conversation, (2) no other evidence
statements are leaked into the conversation, (3) the evidence statements are provided in a colloquial
style, especially for the data and time mentions, and (4) the conversation ends gracefully. In total,
roughly 70% of the sessions are human edited. We note that in a few rare instances, the user
LLM fails by assuming the assistant role instead. When these failures are identified, we discard
the instance if the conversation cannot be fixed.

A.2    H ISTORY C ONSTRUCTION

In order to construct a coherent and freely extensible chat history, we design a three-staged pipeline
that include session pool construction, session sampling, and timestamp resolution.

Session pool construction For each question, we draw the history sessions from three sources:
ShareGPT (Zheng et al., 2023), UltraChat (Ding et al., 2023), and the simulated sessions
corresponding to other attributes using the same pipeline mentioned in the previous section. This
pool ensures that the non-evidence history sessions have similar topic or format as the evidence
sessions, while avoiding providing conflicting information that would invalidate the question.

Session sampling To sample a history containing x sessions, we randomly sample from the
aforementioned three sources and shuffle the sessions together with the question’s evidence sessions.
For L ONG M EM E VAL, we always use the following mixture: 25% ShareGPT, 25% UltraChat, and
50% simulated sessions. If the evidence sessions need to follow a specific order, we swap their
orders accordingly after shuffling.

Timestamp resolution Finally, we randomly assign timestamps to the session following their
order of the history. If the evidence sessions are associated with pre-defined timestamps, we use
them as anchors to determine the range of timestamp of the non-evidence sessions preceding or
following them. Other wise, we randomly assign tiemstamps in May 2023.

A.3    BASIC S TATISTICS

In Figure 9, we present the basic statistics of L ONG M EM E VAL, revealing that most questions require
evidence from multiple sessions (up to six) and that evidence statements are positioned diversely
within sessions, increasing the challenge to the memory design.

A.4   E VALUATION M ETRIC B UILDING

To accurately evaluate the diverse responses of LLMs, we use an expert-written prompt to instruct
GPT-4o as the correctness judge. We present the full prompt in Figure 10. To enable the model
to handle detailed edge cases as how expert evaluators would do, we design separate prompts for
a number of tasks. To ensure the prompt has a high agreement with expert judge, we sample 30
questions per problem type, collect the long-context generation results from GPT-4o and Llama 3.1
8B Instruct, and report the judgment correctness by category.
As shown in Table 6, the prompt-engineered GPT-4o judge achieves reliable performance in
evaluating both GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the generation model. The evaluator’s
judgment slightly deviates from human experts for the single-session-preference and abstention
problems due to the open-ended nature of the response. Nevertheless, our evaluation prompt still
achieves 90% or higher accuracy under all settings. We will include this prompt in the benchmark
package that we will release to enable consistent comparisons for future work.



   temp-reasoning

   I will give you a question, a correct answer, and a response from a model. Please answer
   yes if the response contains the correct answer. Otherwise, answer no. If the response is
   equivalent to the correct answer or contains all the intermediate steps to get the correct
   answer, you should also answer yes. If the response only contains a subset of the information
   required by the answer, answer no. In addition, do not penalize off-by-one errors for the
   number of days. If the question asks for the number of days/weeks/months, etc., and the
   model makes off-by-one errors (e.g., predicting 19 days when the answer is 18), the model’s
   response is still correct.


   knowledge-update

   I will give you a question, a correct answer, and a response from a model. Please answer
   yes if the response contains the correct answer. Otherwise, answer no. If the response
   contains some previous information along with an updated answer, the response should be
   considered as correct as long as the updated answer is the required answer.


   single-session-preference

   I will give you a question, a rubric for desired personalized response, and a response from a
   model. Please answer yes if the response satisfies the desired response. Otherwise, answer
   no. The model does not need to reflect all the points in the rubric. The response is correct
   as long as it recalls and utilizes the user’s personal information correctly.


   Other question types

   I will give you a question, a correct answer, and a response from a model. Please answer
   yes if the response contains the correct answer. Otherwise, answer no. If the response
   is equivalent to the correct answer or contains all the intermediate steps to get the correct
   answer, you should also answer yes. If the response only contains a subset of the information
   required by the answer, answer no.

model’s hypothesis after the instruction and ask GPT-4o to directly generate “yes” or “no”.

B    A H UMAN S TUDY ON C OMMERCIAL M EMORY C HATBOTS

We evaluate two commercial memory-augmented chatbots: ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2024) and Coze
(Coze, 2024). We randomly selected 97 questions and created a short chat history of 3-6 sessions
by sampling according to a mixture of 50% ShareGPT and 50% simulated sessions. We skip two
type of questions that the assistants cannot answer: (1) a subset of temporal-reasoning, since our
manual analysis cannot afford interacting with the (potentially evolving) systems across multiple
months, and (2) single-session-assistant, since the systems do not remember any information given
by the assistant. We also did not evaluate the abstention ability of these two systems because an
early version of the dataset without any abstention questions was used for this analysis.
Since these systems only support memory features via their web interfaces, human annotators
manually interacted with the chat assistants session-by-session, ending with a new session where
the question was posed. After collecting the model’s response, the annotator manually evaluates the
answer’s correctness. Finally, to start evaluating the next instance from a fresh state, the annotator
manually clears the model’s memory through the web interface. We distribute the questions across
five annotators. A discussion is performed among the annotators whenever there is a concern with
the model’s response or with the evidence sessions. All evaluations were conducted in the first two
weeks of August 2024.
In Table 7, we present the detailed human evaluation results by problem types. We observe that when
the task is memorizing the information from a single session (column IE), both systems can answer a
considerable number of problems correctly. However, for the other question types where aggregation
across multiple sessions is generally required, both systems exhibit significant performance drops.
Compared to ChatGPT, we find most of Coze’s errors are due to failing to record information from
some session. On the other hand, ChatGPT generally records the evidence statements immediately
after it has been presented in the evidence session. However, as the interaction proceeds, ChatGPT
often modify this information when it compresses the history, resulting in information loss. This
highlights the potential trade-off between reliable personalization and efficiency.

Table 7: Human evaluation results of two systems categorized by evaluated ability types. We use
the questions from single-session-user for the IE column. For the temporal reasoning column (TR),
we use the questions that do not require reasoning with metadata.

C     U NIFIED M EMORY V IEW
C.1   A N A LTERNATIVE M ATHEMATICAL F ORMULATION

In this section, we provide a more rigorous mathematical formulation of the unified memory
framework for interested readers. Since we find the corresponding natural language descriptions
clear enough for presenting the main arguments while avoiding introducing excessive symbols.
We formulate long-term memory as a massive key-value datastore D = [(k1 , v1 ), (k2 , v2 ), ...],
where the keys ki can be heterogeneous and the values vi might repeat. More concretely, a key
could be discrete or continuous. In the discrete case, the key could be a sentence, a paragraph, a fact,
or an entity, etc. In the continuous case, the key could be e.g., the model’s internal representation
under some inputs. For the three stages, we formulate them with four functions: I, Q, S, R. The
offline index function I(S, D) converts a session S into a series of key-value tuples. Alternatively,
the online index function Ionline (S, D) updates D with the key-value tuples extracted from S,
potentially removing or editing the existing items in D. The query formulation function Q(q)
converts a natural language user query q into a representation q ′ that function S could leverage.
The salience scoring function S(q ′ , D) orders D by their relevance to q ′ . Potential initializations
of S include ranking dense text embedding, graph-based ranking, and so on. Finally, the reading
function R(M, D′ ) combines the model M with D’, the most relevant part as ranked by the salience
scoring function S and generates a response. The methods outlined in the columns of Table 2 could
be seen as different ways to instantiate the four functions I, Q, S, R.

C.2   E XISTING M EMORY S YSTEMS FROM THE U NIFIED V IEW

In §4, we have presented a unified view of the memory systems with three stages and four control
points. In this section, we provide a closer look at nine memory-augmented chat systems and view
them as specific instances of the unified framework. Specifically, we consider in-context RAG (Shi
et al., 2024), Memorybank (Zhong et al., 2024), LD-Agent (Li et al., 2024), CoN (Yu et al., 2023),
ChatGPT, Coze, RAPTOR (Sarthi et al., 2024), MemWalker (Chen et al., 2023a), and HippoRAG
(Gutiérrez et al., 2024). Table 2 provides an overall comparison between the systems, among which
we also situate the recommended design identified through the paper’s empirical study.

Indexing For the value representation, most of the surveyed systems either directly use the
sessions themselves or use a mixture of them with the extracted facts or summaries. Only three
systems (LD-Agent, ChatGPT, and Coze) use only the compressed values to replace the original
ones, which may incur an information loss. When it comes to the indexing key, we observe three
major types of decisions. First, a number of systems (in-context RAG, Memorybank, LD-Agent,
and CoN) simply use the values as the keys, which wins in terms of simplicity. By comparsion,
HippoRAG builds an entity-centric index, and RAPTOR/Memwalker build a hierarchical index
using recursive summarization. It is noteworthy that while a more complex memory indexing
structure can potentially benefit certain types of queries, they also increase the cost of creating
and maintaining the index in online interactions. Specifically, for HippoRAG, RAPTOR, and
Memwalker, some level of re-indexing is required when a new session is added to the memory,
increasing the computational overhead of these sytems.

Retrieval For most of the systems, we find that the question is generally used as the query, which
is intuitive since the questions are generally short. LD-Agent and HippoRAG extract additional
information and leverage them to better pinpoint entity-centric knowledge within the index. In terms
of the query-key matching process, most systems use a flat retrieval setup, where a similarity search
is directly conducted between the query and the keys. HippoRAG uses Personalized PageRank
(PPR) to leverage its entity graph structure to match passages that feature entities close to the seed
entities extracted from the query. Different from these approaches, MemWalker bridges the retrieval
and inference through an interactive reading mechanism where the reader LLM self-navigates the
indexing structure to find the answer. This method brings the additional robustness in case the
retriever fails, but also incurs additional latency costs due to more LLM inference.

Generation Most of the systems apply a direct reading mechanism where the reader model is
provided with the retrieved memory items and directly asked to generate the response. However,

Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025




as we show in the main results, adapting an extract-before-read strategy is important to a high
performance. On the other hand, the interactive reading mechanism such as that used in MemWalker
allows the reader to backtrack and search again in case the recalled memory is inadequate.

D    M EMORY O PTIMIZATIONS : I MPLEMENTATION D ETAILS
In this section, we describe our implementations of the memory optimizations in detail.

Value Decomposition We design an LLM-based method for compressing the value, which are
either sessions or rounds, into three different formats: summaries, keyphrases, or user facts. In
Figure 11, we present the corresponding zero-shot and few-shot prompts. Note that few-shot
learning is only applied for user fact extraction, and we find it to be unnecessary for the rest two
tasks. For in-context examples, we randomly sample ten examples, five from the simulated user
sessions and five from ShareGPT. The expected responses are generated by GPT-4o and modified
by human annotators. We manually tune the prompts by observing several examples. Llama 3.1 8B
Instruct is used for all the extraction experiments. Note that for all the experiments, we only provide
the user-side messages for the extraction, skipping the assistant’s responses.

Key Expansion To expand the value documents with summaries, keyphrases, or user facts, we
follow the same pipeline in the previous section to first extract these pieces of information from
each value. Then, we directly prepend the extracted information to the corresponding key.

Time-Aware Indexing and Query Expansion At the indexing stage, we instruct Llama 3.1 8B
Instruct to extract the event mentions in the text whose timestamp could be inferred. At the retrieval
stage, we instruct an LLM (we explore GPT-4o and Llama 3.1 8B Instruct) to extract the a time range
for retrieval for the problems that specifically focus on a range of time. We present the corresponding
prompts in Figure 12. Ten human-written in-context examples are additionally provided.

Reading Strategy We present the prompt for reading in Figure 13, which is a small variation of
Chain-of-Note (CoN). Overall, the prompt shares the same idea with CoN, that the model is asked
to traverse the documents and extract the evidence before generating the answer to the question. We
use greedy search for all the experiments, and set the maximum generation length to 800 tokens.

   Summaries

   Below is a transcript of a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. Please
   summarize the following dialogue as concisely as possible in a short paragraph, extracting
   the main themes and key information. In your summary, focus more on what the user
   mentioned or asked for. Dialogue content: {session or round}


   Keyphrases

   Below is a transcript of a conversation between a human user and an AI assistant. Generate
   a list of keyphrases for the session. Separate each keyphrase with a semicolon. Dialogue
   content: {session or round}


   User Facts

   You will be given a list of messages from a human user to an AI assistant. Extract all the
   personal information, life events, experience, and preferences related to the user. Make
   sure you include all details such as life events, personal experience, preferences, specific
   numbers, locations, or dates. State each piece of information in a simple sentence. Put
   these sentences in a json list, each element being a standalone personal fact about the user.
   Minimize the coreference across the facts, e.g., replace pronouns with actual entities. If
   there is no specific events, personal information, or preference mentioned, just generate an
   empty list.

   Human user messages: {session}

   Personal facts about the user (a list of strings in json format; do not generate anything else):



Figure 11: Zero-shot prompts for extracting information from the value items for indexing. For user
fact extraction, we additionally provide ten in-context examples.

   Extracting Timestamped Events

   You will be given a list of messages from a human user to an AI assistant, as well as the
   time the conversation took place. Extract all events related to the user as long as its date
   is specified or could be inferred. If the time some event took place cannot be inferred, do
   not extract that event. Return the events in a json list where each item contains two fields:
   ”date” and ”event”. Write date in the form YYYY/MM/DD. If there is no specific event,
   just write an empty list.


   Query Expansion

   You will be given a question from a human user asking about some prvious events, as well as
   the time the question is asked. Infer a potential time range such that the events happening in
   this range is likely to help to answer the question (a start date and an end date). Write a json
   dict two fields: ”start” and ”end”. Write date in the form YYYY/MM/DD. If the question
   does not have any temporal referencea, do not attempt to guess a time range. Instead, just
   say N/A.”

E.1      R ESULTS ON M ORE LLM S

In Table 8, we evaluate five more models on L ONG M EM E VAL: the 1B and 3B models of Llama-
3.2 Instruct (Dubey et al., 2024), Qwen-2.5-7B (Team, 2024), Phi-3.5-mini-instruct (Abdin et al.,
2024b), and Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407 (Mistral AI Team, 2024). Overall, we observe that
the performance is consistent with the results reported in the paper. For instance, long-context
performance on L ONG M EM E VAL S is significantly lower than the oracle retrieval performance. In
addition, the fact-based key expansion and CoN consistently improves the performance.

reading from the entire history without any memory operations. For the last four columns that have
memory operations, we always use round as the value granularity.


E.2      A BLATIONS ON R ETRIEVER S ELECTION

In Table 9, we compare the performance of Stella V5 with two alternative popular retrievers: BM25
(Robertson & Zaragoza, 2009) and Contriever (Izacard et al., 2022). We do not report the results
of retrievers that use larger embedding models, as their latency is generally unrealistic for real
applications. The retrievers are compared under two settings: (1) vanilla key design where the
values themselves are used as the key and (2) the key expansion strategies introduced in the main
text. We list the key observations below:

         • Both dense retrieval embeddings have significantly higher performance than the BM25
           sparse retrieval method. The trend is the same across most settings.
         • The recommended technique of performing key expansion with user fact consistently
           improves the performance over directly using the value as the key.
         • Key expansion with summary and keyphrases could improve the performance in some
           settings. For example, both summary and keyphrase improve the Recall@5 of Contriever
           when session is used as the value granularity. However, expanding the key with facts still
           gives the greatest performance gain.


E.3      P OST- RETRIEVAL RANK MERGING FOR INDEX EXPANSION

In §5.3, we have introduced and evaluated the key expansion strategy for multi-path retrieval, where
important information is extracted from the value items and then used to augment the key. However,
an alternative strategy is to directly create a separate key with the retrieved information and place it
in parallel as the original keys. At the retrieval stage, the query could be used to retrieve from pools
defined multiple types of keys and the values from different sequences could be merged subsequently
according to their rank. Effectively, this implements the true “multi-path retrieval. We call this
strategy “rank merging”. In Table 10, we thoroughly evaluate rank merging verse key merging, the
strategy we recommended in the main text. We find that rank merging has much lower performance
than key merging. One potential reason is that rank merging increases the index size by m + 1 times,
where m is the number of information pieces extracted from each (key, value) pair. By comparison,
key merging highlights the important information while avoiding explording the size of the index.

E.4     S TRONG AND WEAK LLM S FOR EXTRACTING TIME RANGES FROM QUERIES

In §5.4, we concluded that a strong model is required to accurately extract the time ranges from
the questions, even if in-context examples (with balanced labels) are provided. In this section, we
further illustrate this finding with examples in Table 11. We find that the Llama 3.1 8B Instruct
model can generate a correct temporal range when the time references are clearly defined (example
2). However, in many of the cases where the question does not have any temporal reference (example
1, 2, 4), the model often mistakenly extracts a time range, which erroneously prunes out the search
space, leading to a low memory recall. By contrast, GPT-4o is able to refuse to generate a time range
when the question does not have a time reference.

E.5     E RROR A NALYSIS

In this section, we analyze the source of error of various LLMs with our best memory design.
Specifically, we use round as the value granularity, expand the key with extracted user facts,
and apply CoN as the reading strategy. Stella v5 1.5B is used as the retriever, and top-10
items are provided to the model with a JSON structured prompt. In Figure 14, we analyze the
distribution of the correct and error cases for three different reader LLMs. First, we observe that a
substantial proportion of errors corresponds to correct retrieval yet wrong generation (15%∼19% of
all instances, and 40%∼50% among the error instances). The proportion is higher when a weaker

 Example 1
 Question Date: 2023/05/28
 Question: How long had I been taking guitar lessons when I bought the new guitar amp?
 Predicted time range (GPT-4o): No date extracted [correct]
 Predicted time range (Llama 3.1 8B Instruct): 2023/05/01∼2023/05/28 [false positive]
 Example 2

 Question: Which airline did I fly with the most in March and April?
 Predicted time range (GPT-4o): 2023/03/01∼2023/04/30 [correct]
 Predicted time range (Llama 3.1 8B Instruct): 2023/03/01∼2023/04/30 [correct]

 Question: How many days before the ’Rack Fest’ did I participate in the ’Turbocharged Tuesdays’
 event?
 Predicted time range (GPT-4o): No date extracted [correct]
 Predicted time range (Llama 3.1 8B Instruct): 2023/06/21∼2023/06/28 [false positive]

 Predicted time range (GPT-4o): No date extracted [correct]
 Predicted time range (Llama 3.1 8B Instruct): 2023/03/01∼2023/03/10 [false positive]


reader LLM is used. This indicates that the reading strategy still has a large room of improvement.
In addition, we observe that for the reader LLM to generate a correct answer, performing correct
retrieval is necessary in ∼90% of the time. We observe that the rest 10% instances are mostly of the
question type knowledge-update and the retriever was only able to identify the updated knowledge
but failed to retrieved the previous information before update. For these cases, our strict retrieval
evaluation criteria will deem that the retrieval has failed. Overall, this result also highlights the high
quality of L ONG M EM E VAL, as the reader LLM cannot take any shortcut to answer the question
correctly without a correct memory recall.
