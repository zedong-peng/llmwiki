Deployment kit for serving **Qwen3.8-27B** quantized to EXL3 3.5bpw
with speculative decoding — **MTP by default** (draft head inside the
checkpoint, best context per GB) or **DFlash2** (EXL3 5.0bpw draft model,
~15% faster) — plus a ~4.5-bit KV cache lane (NVFP4 on Ada/Hopper/Blackwell,
Hadamard-4 on Ampere) for maximum context per GB.

This repo contains the launcher, server and configuration. The model weights
live on Hugging Face (see [Model cards](#model-cards)) and the inference
engine is our [exllamav3 fork](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/exllamav3)
(DFlash2/MTP drafting, NVFP4/FP8 KV, aarch64 GB10 + x86 CUDA).

## What's in the box

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `start.sh` | env-driven launcher for the OpenAI-compatible server |
| `stop.sh` | stop the server (graceful shutdown, safe to re-run) |
| `tools/serve_openai.py` | the server itself (chat completions, streaming, tool calling) |
| `.env.example` | documented configuration knobs |
| `model-cards/` | model cards for the two HF weight sets |

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. configure and launch:
cp .env.example .env      # edit: context, GPU memory
./start.sh                # first run: builds .venv + installs the engine,
                          # downloads weights, serves http://localhost:8888/v1
```

`start.sh` is self-bootstrapping: on first run it creates `.venv`, installs
GPU torch and pip-installs the exllamav3 engine from this fork (all of
DFlash2/MTP drafting, NVFP4/FP8 KV and the aarch64 GB10 port are fork
features). `EXL3_REPO` in `.env` overrides where the engine comes from — any
git URL or a local path.

Running on a 24 GB GPU (RTX 3090/4090)? Jump to
[24 GB config](#24-gb-gpus-rtx-3090--4090).

`start.sh` auto-creates `.env` from the example on first run, prefers
`.venv/bin/python` when present, and **downloads the target and draft weight
sets from Hugging Face automatically** on first launch (and resumes partial
downloads) — no manual fetching. Set `HF_TARGET_REPO` / `HF_DRAFT_REPO` in
`.env` to pull from a mirror instead.

## Configuration highlights (`.env`)

- `DRAFT` — speculative decoding method: `mtp` (default; the draft head
  lives inside the target checkpoint — no download, ~50% more context on
  small GPUs), `dflash2` (dedicated draft model, fastest tokens/s), or
  `none`. `MODEL_DIR` / `DRAFT_DIR` set the target and (for dflash2) draft
  locations; missing dirs are fetched from the Hub automatically
  (`HF_TARGET_REPO` / `HF_DRAFT_REPO` override the repo ids)
- `CONTEXT_SIZE` — KV cache size in tokens (native limit 262,144; 1M works and
  the launcher swaps in the YaRN config variant automatically)
- `CACHE_QUANT` — KV format: `none` (fp16) / `8` / `8,4` / `4` / `fp8` / `nvfp4`.
  `nvfp4` and `fp8` need compute capability ≥ 8.9 (Ada 4090, Hopper, Blackwell /
  GB10). Ampere (3090, sm_86) cannot compile those Triton kernels — use
  Hadamard `4` (~4.5 bits/elem, same density as NVFP4) or `8` / `8,4`
- `GPU_MEM_GB` — memory budget for weights + caches; auto-detected when unset
  (discrete GPU: VRAM − 2 GB, unified/GB10: available RAM − 16 GB)
- `CPU_CACHE_GB` — CPU second-tier cache knob (accepted but not yet active;
  see the 24 GB notes)

Concurrency note: the server generates one request at a time (batch-1
speculative decoding); concurrent requests queue automatically. Measured on
DGX Spark with `DRAFT=dflash2`: 8 concurrent requests ran fully sequentially
(no batching benefit), aggregate throughput ~16.7 tok/s at that concurrency
— plan capacity accordingly if your workload is concurrent rather than
single-request.

Reasoning note: the server always reasons — there is currently no way to
disable it. `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking` (the vLLM/SGLang
convention) is silently ignored. The reasoning trace comes back in a
separate `reasoning_content` field (both in the full response and in each
streamed `delta`), but it is **not** a separate token budget: reasoning and
visible `content` both draw from the same `max_tokens`. With a tight budget
(e.g. `max_tokens: 16` on a short-answer prompt) I got a response with no
`content` at all, entirely consumed by the reasoning trace — clients
expecting a quick, cheap warmup/probe call should budget generously rather
than assuming a short `max_tokens` implies a short wait.

## 24 GB GPUs (RTX 3090 / 4090)

The kit targets DGX Spark (121 GB) by default. On a 24 GB card the recipe is
the same weights, a tighter KV budget, and a ~4.5-bit KV format so the native
262k context still fits. The default drafter (MTP) is the right choice here.

**KV format is GPU-dependent.** This fork's `nvfp4` / `fp8` lanes are software
packed caches (E2M1 + E4M3 scales, or raw E4M3) with Triton online dequant.
Those kernels use `fp8e4nv`, which Triton only compiles on compute capability
**≥ 8.9**. They are **not** Blackwell tensor-core NVFP4 matmul.

| GPU | Arch | `CACHE_QUANT` for 262k |
|---|---|---|
| RTX 4090, GB10, Hopper+ | sm ≥ 8.9 | `nvfp4` (measured lossless at generation level) |
| RTX 3090 | Ampere sm_86 | `4` (Hadamard int4; same ~4.5 bits/elem). `nvfp4` and `fp8` will fail to compile |

```bash
# .env — 24 GB recipe (MTP, the default)
GPU_MEM_GB=22            # auto-detected when unset; explicit for clarity
CONTEXT_SIZE=262144      # full native context fits (see math below)
CACHE_QUANT=nvfp4        # 4090 / GB10 / Hopper+. On a 3090 use: CACHE_QUANT=4
# DRAFT=mtp is the default — no extra config, no draft download
```

- **`DRAFT=mtp` (default)**: no draft weights, ~20% less KV per token → the
  full native 262k context fits fully resident, at ~30 tok/s (GB10; an RTX
  card should be faster — decode is memory-bandwidth-bound).
- **`DRAFT=dflash2`**: ~34.5 tok/s but 1.4 GB of draft weights + draft KV →
  ~220k–262k tokens fully resident.

```bash
# .env — alternative: DFlash2 at 24 GB
GPU_MEM_GB=22
CONTEXT_SIZE=200000
CACHE_QUANT=nvfp4        # 3090: CACHE_QUANT=4
DRAFT=dflash2
DRAFT_DIR=models/Qwen3.8-27B-DFlash2-EXL3-5.0bpw   # auto-downloaded
# CPU_CACHE_GB=16        # CPU spill tier: NOT YET ACTIVE (planned; see notes)
```

Memory math (GiB): target weights 14.2 + MTP head ~0.05 → ~6.7 GB left for
KV at a 22 GB budget; NVFP4 or Hadamard-4 KV costs ~18 KB/token for the
target plus ~1.2 KB/token for the MTP head (only the 16 full-attention layers
hold KV; fp16 is ~64 KB/token) → the full native 262k fits with ~1 GB to
spare. With the DFlash2 draft instead: 15.6 GiB of weights + ~24 KB/token →
~220k–262k. `CACHE_QUANT=8` (~8.5 bits) needs ~9.1 GB at 262k and will not
leave that much headroom; fp16 (~17 GB at 262k) does not fit. Past the
resident limit the cache does not hold today; the CPU spill tier is planned
but not yet implemented.

RTX-class notes (vs the DGX Spark the numbers above were measured on):

- **Perf is memory-bandwidth-bound at batch 1, and should be *higher* on an
  RTX card**: GB10 reads weights from ~273 GB/s-class LPDDR5x unified memory;
  a 3090/4090 reads the same weights from ~1 TB/s-class VRAM. Acceptance and
  quality are unchanged — only tok/s moves. Not yet benchmarked on RTX, treat
  the table in the model cards as the lower bound.
- **CPU spill (planned, `CPU_CACHE_GB`)**: once implemented (T6 follow-up),
  a desktop's 32–64 GB of system RAM backs cold KV pages over PCIe — slow to
  touch, but it converts the hard ~220k resident limit into a graceful
  decline. Today the knob is accepted but inert.
- **The 1M YaRN config does not fit**: 1M tokens of ~4.5-bit KV ≈ 19 GB on
  top of 15.6 GB of weights. Only reachable with CPU spill, and 262k is the
  quality-faithful limit anyway — don't expect the 1M headroom to be useful
  here.
- **Use the fork on x86 too**: stock exllamav3 serves the model on CUDA, but
  NVFP4/FP8 KV and DFlash2 drafting are fork features; install the fork's x86
  CUDA build. Hadamard `4` / `8` / `8,4` KV is upstream.
- Need more context than ~262k? That requires the YaRN 1M config and more
  memory than a 24 GB card has. `DRAFT=none` frees the draft memory too, but
  gives up speculative decoding — `DRAFT=mtp` already dominates it on both
  memory and speed.

## Tool calling

OpenAI-style `tools` / `tool_choice` work (referenced in the file table
above but not otherwise documented here). Verified request/response shape:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8888/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b-exl3-3.5bpw-wm",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in Lyon?"}],
    "tools": [{
      "type": "function",
      "function": {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get current weather",
        "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["city"]}
      }
    }],
    "tool_choice": "auto",
    "max_tokens": 300
  }'
```

Returns a normal OpenAI `tool_calls` array (`finish_reason: "tool_calls"`,
`message.content: null`) alongside the usual `reasoning_content`. The
`model` id in responses doesn't necessarily match `HF_TARGET_REPO` or
`MODEL_DIR` verbatim (I saw `qwen3.8-27b-exl3-3.5bpw-wm` for
`MODEL_DIR=models/Qwen3.8-27B-EXL3-3.5bpw`) — check `/v1/models` rather
than assuming the id a client should send.
